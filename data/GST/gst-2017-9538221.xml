Therefore, to keep these businesses healthy and functioning for the long term, it is always good to be able to keep pace with changing times and its requirements. It is also here, where India’s biggest fiscal reforms since independence-the Goods and Services tax- will actually reveal its biggest impact, although in a good way. At the heart of the GST reform is digitization- a revolutionary idea that will bring all SMBs at par with technology development and allow them to thrive, having built in efficiencies and timeliness to their daily workings. It really is a win-win for not only the government, since tax filings by businesses become inherently transparent, it also allows SMBs to grow business by almost 15% in a single year, given technology will help them wipe-out redundancies from their systems. That said, it is also true that in order to comply with GST, SMBs will have to be well-versed with certain GST-unique details, such as input tax credit, destination system, twin rates etc, that are best left to technology. So, what are these technologies that can then help SMBs better manage GST?" width="378" height="213" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2368635" /><p></p><img src="http://livecms.moneycontrol.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2.2-1-378x213.jpg" alt="1.Personal Computers – PCs are immensely important when it comes to making businesses more profitable.
