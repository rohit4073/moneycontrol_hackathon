There are problems regarding uploading the returns and matching invoices. This the first time GSTR-2 is being filed and hence there are issues," said Modi.<p></p>So far, nearly 12 lakh businesses have filed GSTR-2 returns. GST was rolled out on July 1.<p></p>The panel assigned more functions to GSTN which handles the technology backbone for GST as well as IT major Infosys, responsible for the back-end processes.<p></p>"GSTR-2 is more challenging because there will be matching of invoices. As many as 45 crore invoices were uploaded in GSTR-1 which have to be matched," Modi added.<p></p>While sales return or GSTR-1 was filed until October 10, it has to be matched with purchase return GSTR-2.<p></p>The primary focus of GSTN so far has been registering taxpayers in GST, making the files GSTR-3B, GSTR-1 and composition of dealers. Now, GSTN will focus on GSTR-2.<p></p>The GoM also raised the issues faced by businesses in different states and asked Infosys to deploy their engineers there.<p></p>"We had earlier asked Infosys to deploy engineers in major states by October 30. They have done so in 9 states and sought time till November end to deploy in other states," Modi said.<p></p>Infosys has already deployed more than 100 IT people in their team for GSTN functioning.<p></p>Modi said that the GoM has given a mandate to Infosys and GSTN to make the IT system more user-friendly.<p></p>"There should be more pop up messages, more offline utilities, editing facilities for businesses transacting on the portal," he said.]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d01.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2017/356x200/s/shutterstock_549852313_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2017-10-28 20:29:09</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><sc_id>,PP16, IT,</sc_id><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
