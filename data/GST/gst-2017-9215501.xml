The minister said the best way in which smaller quantities of cargo can be accommodated is through the PPP initiative.<p></p>"There are players who can bring in cargo to the railway point. There are private freight terminals which can keep them and then it can go in the railways," Prabhu told a gathering of industrialists here.<p></p>The vision document to make Indian Railways the best in the world by 2030, is ready and the ground work has started, he said. Prabhu said that Railways is working on a structured plan which will encourage multi-modal transportation. It will help in connecting ports, he said adding his ministry is working with other ministries to make all these things a reality.<p></p>Referring to the new GST regime, Prabhu said, "many things have happened in India, and this is the right time to take those things ahead." Â  "Five days ago, we created a unified market by bringing in a path-breaking legislation. Now we can move goods from one place to another without any hindrance," he said.<p></p>Prabhu also said that this is right time to think about logistics as a new destination for investment.]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d02.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2017/356x200/S/Suresh_Prabhu_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2017-07-05 13:27:16</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
