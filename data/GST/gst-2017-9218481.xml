Easing liquidity pressures with fading impact of demonetisation, extended wedding season, better farm output and rising income levels have supported the growth. Further, the demand is unlikely to be impacted by the GST rate which at three per cent is only marginally higher than the earlier rates," ICRA Senior Group Vice President Subrata Ray said.<p></p>The net tax outgo post-GST is in fact seen declining by one percent for a retailer (where jewellery manufacturing is outsourced and input credit is availed) and increasing by 1.2 percent (if credit is not availed), he added.<p></p>"This will trigger the retailers to source from tax compliant suppliers and goldsmiths enabling them to claim input tax credit on jewellery and other services availed. The transition towards streamlining of theÂ supply chain will be challenging with some temporary impact on demand," he added.<p></p>ICRA also said there is likely to be consolidation in the near to medium term, where organised players may acquire smaller entities or enter into franchise agreements.]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d01.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2017/356x200/g/gold-metal-commodity-jewellery_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2017-07-05 19:52:16</Entry_Date><Category>Business</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
