"Our members have informed us that it would be impossible for them to export in August and September as per this refund time schedule. We request and kindly urge the finance ministry to make the GSTN operative for processing returns and refunds by the beginning of August," EEPC India said in its communication to the finance and commerce ministries.<p></p>According to the exporters' body, as supply of goods to the export oriented units (EoU) from domestic tariff area are not considered as "deemed exports" in the GST regime, shippers are not allowed to import the inputs without payment of duty under Advance Authorisation.<p></p>Moreover, exporters will have to pay the basic customs duty, cesses and IGST for imported inputs to be used for supplies to EoU. They are entitled to input tax credit of only IGST. Basic customs duty and cesses are thereon a cost to them.]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d01.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2017/356x200/l/logistic-new_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2017-08-07 18:52:12</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
