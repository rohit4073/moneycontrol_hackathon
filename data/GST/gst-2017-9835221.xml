The index of industrial production for August -- due this week -- is poised to extend gains from July's 1.2 per cent, said DBS in its daily economic report today.<p></p>As GST-driven distortions fade, expectations are set on festive-driven demand, good monsoon, remonetisation and higher disposable income following an increase in wage or allowances to provide support to the production outlook, it said. Production in 2017-18 is likely to be around 2%, slower than last year's 4.6 per cent, added the Singapore banking group.<p></p>It saw more such pockets of improvement in high-frequency data prints, including core industries index, PMIs (Purchasing Managers Index) and auto sales. This should translate into a growth average of 6-7 per cent in the second half of 2017-18 after the trough in the June quarter, the bank stated.<p></p>While this still implies that full-year growth will be at a three-year low, the urgency to adopt pump-priming measures is lower, the lender felt. In the long run, the onus is on the government to support growth once the impact of GST uncertainty rolls off, it added.<p></p>More emphasis will be on recovery of non-performing assets and rebuilding bank balancesheets, according to DBS.<p></p>It sees less room for further rate cuts, with the budget seen to modestly miss its 2017-18 targets owing to revenue shortfall. A less rigid deficit target will also reduce the extent to which spending needs are to be compressed in the second half of this fiscal.<p></p>The lending agency also noted that the government has just relaxed a handful of GST restrictions by lowering rates on 27 items and 12 services.]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d01.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2017/356x200/d/dbs-bank_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2017-10-09 13:05:28</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
