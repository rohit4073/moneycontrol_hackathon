The incentives will be more in Bundelkhand and Poorvanchal," he said.<p></p>On a question of revival of textile mills in Kanpur, the UP industrial development minister said, "After assuming office, I held two meetings with Union minister Smriti Irani, and requested her to help in the revival of the textile mills.
