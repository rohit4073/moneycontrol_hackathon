But the tax the hotel or restaurant operators paid on inputs could not be set off against the tax on final bill.<p></p>This facility, called input tax credit (ITC), is available in the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime.<p></p><strong>Must watch: Another Tryst With Destiny!

So ITC should be accounted for now in form of reduction in the value of supplies which they are giving," Adhia said in GST Master Class.<p></p>Under the GST regime, while non-airconditioned restaurants attract 12 per cent tax, AC restaurants and those serving liquor will attract 18 per cent.<p></p>Adhia further said that anything that is served as part of restaurant bill will be subject to GST, barring alcohol on which Value Added Tax (VAT) will be levied.<p></p>"On the entire value of food bill, including service charge, on that portion also GST will apply," he said.<p></p>Adhia further said that the tax department has received representation for transition provision of lease service industry.<p></p>As per the GST provisions, ITC will not be available for central excise already paid on cars which are on lease.<p></p>"There are a lot of representations on this about transition for lease service industry. We are looking at the representation but we are not sure how to handle this," Adhia said.]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d02.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2017/356x200/r/restaurant-cafe-hotel-eateri_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2017-07-11 20:41:21</Entry_Date><Category>Business</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
