These included lowering rates on man-made yarn to 12 per cent from 18 per cent as well as zari job work to 5 per cent from the 12 per cent earlier.<p></p>"The changes will give a great relief to the apparel industry for the immediate term as the sector has been facing severe liquidity crunch after the introduction of GST," AEPC Chairman Ashok Rajani said.<p></p>AEPC also demanded that the government look into the issue of embedded taxes on exports. "Since the duty structure remains inverted with fabric at 5 per cent GST, we are hopeful that the embedded taxes arising out of this inverted structure will be refunded to exporters through appropriate mechanisms," Rajani said.]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d03.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2017/356x200/1/15-1_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2017-10-08 15:25:22</Entry_Date><Category>Tax</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
