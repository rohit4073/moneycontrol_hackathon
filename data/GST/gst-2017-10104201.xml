We feel a step like this would go a long way in boosting demand. The buyers stand to benefit as developers would pass on the benefit to the buyers," Talwar said.<p></p>The government would benefit as well as it will collect more tax because of increase in demand, he added.<p></p>According to Naredco, capping GST at 6 percent will incentivise buyers to invest in under-construction properties and not wait for completed properties to save 12 percent GST.<p></p>Hiranandani said: "Land cost is the most significant part of the project cost in a real estate project. The abatement of 30 per cent for land cost is not enough and it should be pegged at 50 per cent, even though the land cost in cities like Mumbai and Delhi NCR it may go up to 60-70 percent of the property cost.]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d02.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2017/356x200/I/Infra_construction_LT_Larsen_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2017-11-22 22:15:07</Entry_Date><Category>Real Estate</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
