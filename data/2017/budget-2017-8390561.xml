]]></Summary><Body><![CDATA[<strong>Moneycontrol Bureau<br /></strong><br />Demonetisation has been a bold decision of the government against black money, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said is his Budget speech today. <br /><br />"We are moving from informal to formal economy and the government is now seen as a trusted custodian of public money," he said.<br /><br />The impact of cash crunch will not spill over the next financial year. Demonetisation will create a new normal for a bigger, cleaner Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and any impact, if there is, will be transient. <br /><br />Demonetisation and the Goods &amp; Services Tax (GST) both will have great impact on the economy and lives of the people. Jaitley also assured that the re-monetisation pace has picked-up in the economy.<br /><br />On November 8, the government had launched the demonetisation drive - banning of high currency notes - to curb black money and to digitize the economy.<br /><br />Finance Minister further said that demonetisation will transfer resources from tax evaders to the government. &nbsp;<br />
