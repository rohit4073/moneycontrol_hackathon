<p>The government today set the disinvestment target of about Rs 60,000 crore for the financial year 2017-18, higher by 6.2 percent year-on-year from the current year&rsquo;s revised target Rs 45,500 crore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The disinvestment programme of the Government has been scaled up in 2017-18 in comparison to the previous years. The increase of Rs 27,000 crore over 2016-17 is based on the assumption that the disinvestment will&nbsp; be&nbsp; pursued&nbsp; with&nbsp; greater&nbsp; vigour, based&nbsp; on&nbsp; proactive&nbsp; policy&nbsp; decisions&nbsp; taken&nbsp; by&nbsp; the government,&rdquo; the finance ministry said in the budget documents tabled in Parliament on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Finance minister Arun Jaitley said that listing of public sector enterprises (PSEs) will foster greater public accountability and unlock the true value of these companies.</p>
<p>The government will put in place a revised mechanism and procedure to ensure time bound listing of identified CPSEs on stock exchanges. The shares of Railway PSEs like IRCTC, IRFC and IRCON will be listed in stock exchanges, Jaitley said.</p>
<p>The government has also carried out disinvestment through the exchange traded fund (ETF) route that allows simultaneous sale of government stake in various CPSEs through a single offering and avoids the necessity to go to the market repeatedly for divesting different stocks.</p>
<p>The CPSE-ETF provides a mechanism for the government to monetize its shareholding in those CPSEs that eventually form part of the CPSE ETF basket, in a stock-neutral, time-efficient and non-disruptive manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our exchange traded funds, comprising shares of ten CPSEs, has received overwhelming response in the recent Further Fund Offering (FFO). We will continue to use ETF as a vehicle for further disinvestment of shares. Accordingly, a new ETF with diversified CPSE stocks and other Government holdings will be launched in 2017-18&rdquo; Jaitley said.</p>
<p>The Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) has so far realized about Rs 30,000 crore of disinvestment revenues.</p>
Earning extra revenues through state-controlled companies&rsquo; dividends and selling equity in such companies is critical for next year&rsquo;s central Budget math.]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d01.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2014/356x200/j/JAITLEY_0720_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2017-02-01 19:56:26</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
