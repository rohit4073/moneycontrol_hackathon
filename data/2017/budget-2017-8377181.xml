<p>The fourth Budget of the present Government will be presented on February 1, 2017. Like every Budget, this has created a lots of hypes, hopes and expectations &ndash; more so, this time &ndash; if seen in the backdrop of demonetization and possibly slowing growth rates.</p>
<p>The year gone by seems to be one of the most busiest year for the Central Board of Direct Taxes &ndash; it issued more than 45 circulars, 120+ notifications, handful of instructions and office memoranda, 120+ Advance Pricing Agreements signed (with 8 of them being bilateral) and not to forget, various amnesty schemes and real time data analysis after demonetization to crack money laundering and unearth black money.</p>
<p>It is important for the Government to refocus on its strategic intent rather than making the Budget a populist one.</p>
<p>One of the important strategic initiatives of this Government is "Ease of Doing Business in India&rdquo;. While a lot of work has been initiated on this front, but <em>yeh dil maange more</em>!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;Summarised below are some of them for the financial services industry.</p>
<p><strong>Requirement for foreign banks to get a certificate under section 195(3):</strong> An important step was taken earlier by not restricting the issuance of such a certificate merely because the foreign banks were subjected to penalty proceedings. The foreign banks have an impeccable track record of discharging all their taxes by way of advance tax and self-assessment taxes and the Government should consider doing away with the annual requirement of such certificate, in this backdrop.</p>
<p><strong>Allowing Non-Banking Finance Companies (NBFCs) to receive interest without deduction of tax at source:</strong> TDS on interest receipts by NBFCs has plagued this industry with a lot of cash flow and operational inefficiencies. The tax payable by NBFCs on net income at 35 percent can be significantly lower than the TDS on gross interest income at 10 percent. This also puts a lot of pressure to reconcile the TDS as per their records and the TDS as per Form 26AS, which is, by itself, a mammoth task and receiving tax refunds only after the tax returns are filed.</p>
<p>It is important to bring such business in parity with similar businesses carried on by banks. If there are other reasons for which the Government may not want to extend this to all NBFCs, it can provide this benefit for NBFCs that are systemically important in accordance with the RBI regulations.</p>
<p><strong>Offshore funds bringing FDI in the country &ndash; an identity crisis:</strong> While the global portfolio investors have an identity in form of FPIs, the domestic funds being identified as AIFs, there is a much required need to provide an identity to offshore funds investing in India in the Income-tax Act, 1961.&nbsp; These offshore funds have a real potential to raise monies from sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, development financial institutions, insurance companies, etc. and bring much needed FDI in the country.</p>
<p>Once they have an identity, it will be easy for the government to appreciate the industry&rsquo;s asks that are genuinely towards the strategic intent of ease of doing business in India.</p>
<p>&nbsp;While it may be slightly late to incorporate these as part of the budget proposals and make changes to the budget speech, some of them can surely be considered at the time of enacting the Finance Bill, 2017.</p>
