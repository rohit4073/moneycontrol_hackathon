<p>According to him, Budget is likely to focus disproportionately on affordable housing as an engine of economic revival.</p>
<p>Further announcements on roadmap for rationalising the corporate tax architecture by lowering the tax rate and phasing out exemptions are expected, he says.</p>
<p>Tax on financial market transactions and an overhaul of direct taxation by reducing tax incidence for the middle class, likely financed through a mix of tax on financial instruments and higher tax rate at the upper end of the income pyramid can be expected, Laijawala feels.</p>]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d03.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2014/356x200/a/Abhay-Laijawala-356_3802_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2017-01-19 09:15:40</Entry_Date><Category>FII View</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
