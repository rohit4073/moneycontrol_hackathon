With the Infrastructure status bestowed upon the affordable housing segment,&nbsp; the cost of borrowing is expected to reduce for developers, thereby boosting the supply of affordable houses in the country. <br /><br />Furthermore, by increasing the PMAY allocation to Rs 23,000 crore, redefining affordable housing by carpet area &amp; the previously announced subsidies, the government has laid down its intention&nbsp; to provide affordable housing the best possible boost. Also allowing property owners the benefits of capital gains after two years will also boost ownership in a country where real estate is still the most trusted investment option. This is a great budget for stakeholders across the Housing Sector."]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d03.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2017/356x200/5/500_note_Budget_2017_rupee_356x200_3015_356.png]]></Image><Entry_Date>2017-02-02 09:07:01</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
