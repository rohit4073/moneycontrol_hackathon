<p>The scheme, under which 200 million poor could get Rs 1,500 a month and cost the government around Rs 3 lakh crore, could form the basis of a national social security system. However, there is a dilemma over whether it should be universal basic income or support limited to the most vulnerable.</p>
<p>NITI Aayog vice-chairman Arvind Panagariya had said last month that he was in favour of targeted instead of universal tranfers.</p>
<p>The report quoted a person familiar with the deliberations as saying the target group may include unemployed people with no source of income. A suggestion has been made to entrust the money with the woman of the household to ensure the funds are better utilised.</p>
<p>"There is a thinking... pros and cons of having such a scheme are being examined," a government official was quoted as saying. The official added such a programme can have broad implications in terms of delivery as well as the fiscal deficit, and any decision will have to be taken keeping these factors in mind.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> Similar schemes are in place abroad. While Finland recently announced a basic income scheme for anyone seeking employment, the UK government offers a jobseeker's allowance for the unemployed.&nbsp;Last week, Jammu &amp; Kashmir became the first Indian state to commit to the idea of a universal basic income.</p>]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d02.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2015/356x200/i/india_poor_rich_inequality_356_200_2812_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2017-01-17 09:04:14</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
