An announcement is expected in the budget 2017-18 on February 1, a source, who did not wish to be identified, told Moneycontrol.<br /><br />In Budget 2016-17, Jaitley had converted the Rs 4,500 a tonne fixed levy on crude oil to 20 percent ad valorem charge, with an aim to reduce the impact. However, oil producers claimed that they pay more than Rs 4,500 a tonne, considering a surge in current crude prices to around USD 54 a barrel now from about USD 45 a few months ago.<br /><br />The producers want finance ministry to reduce the cess to 8 percent of the price they realise on sale of domestically produced crude oil.<br /><br />The Oil Industry (Development) Act, 1974, provides for collection of cess as a duty of excise on indigenous crude oil. Cess incurred by producers is not recoverable from refineries. As a result, it forms part of cost of production of crude oil. The cess was levied at Rs 60 per tonne in July 1974 and subsequently revised from time to time.<br /><br />During 2005-06, when crude oil prices had increased from an average of USD 40 per barrel to USD 60 per barrel, the cess was increased from Rs 1,800 to Rs 2,500 per tonne from March 1, 2006.<br /><br />When the crude oil prices increased to over USD 100 per barrel, the rate of cess was increased by the government to Rs 4,500 per tonne (USD 10 per barrel) with effect from March 17, 2012.</p>]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d01.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2015/356x200/i/InfographicGE_IndiasCrudeOilImport_4940_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2017-01-19 12:10:24</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><sc_id>,ONG,CI37,</sc_id><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
