<p>Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has set the momentum for digital payments by setting target of Rs 2,500 crore of &nbsp;digital transactions in 2017-18, using diverse payment instruments, &nbsp;UPI, USSD, Aadhar Pay, IMPS and debit cards. Equally important are several other announcements in the Budget that will discourage the payments by cash. There is emphasis on the &nbsp;strengthening of digital payment infrastructure. &nbsp;<br /><br />Banks have targeted to introduce additional 10 lakh new PoS terminals by March 2017. RS Software has the expertise of building core payment systems that execute trillions of US Dollar value of transactions, and is now all prepared to be the premier choice in the country for enablement and payment of digital payment transactions. <br /><br />With this Budget, we believe India will be the fastest country to adopt digital payments, benefiting RS Software&rsquo;s strategic direction.</p>]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d01.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2017/356x200/j/Jaitley_FM_budget_2017_356x200_0115_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2017-02-01 19:02:18</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
