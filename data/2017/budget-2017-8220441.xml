They also sought continuation of tax incentives and benefits for the renewable energy sector beyond March.<br /><br />In late October, Modi set up 10 groups of senior officials to "undertake a critical review" of the government's work in a number of areas, including energy, transport and agriculture.<br /><br />India, the world's third biggest oil consumer, has also tasked its state-run oil companies to set up ethanol plants at 12 locations within a year.<br /><br />Among other "key planned actions", the group has asked for long-term loans and introduction of interest subsidies of 4 percent in six months for hydro projects with more than 100 megawatts (MW) of annual capacity.<br /><br />To curb diesel consumption, India wants to raise the number of electric vehicles on roads to 7 million by 2020 from just around 20,000 now. The group proposed the use of electric vehicles in public transport and for government vehicles within three years.<br /><br />The bulk of goods in India are transported by road in diesel-guzzling trucks because of higher rail freight costs that compensate for low passenger fares and account for about two-thirds of railways' revenue.<br /><br />To further restrict diesel use, the panel proposed indexing passenger fares in railways to fuel costs, within a year.]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d01.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2014/356x200/p/PetronetLNG365_4004_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2017-01-06 10:47:21</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
