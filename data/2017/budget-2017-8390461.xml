<p>"They had information (about E Ahmed's death) and could have decided yesterday (to make it public) but they put that on hold. They thought they will take a decision after the presentation of the Budget.</p>
<p>"This is an inhuman act. To deal with a politician like this at such a time is not acceptable. There is ample time for conducting the Budget. They could have postponed the Budget and conducted it tomorrow but they have dismissed this," Kharge told reporters.</p>
<p>The senior Congress leader also said that he will be going to Kerala to meet MPs and discuss the issue and will thereafter take up this matter in Parliament in an appropriate manner.</p>
<p>78-year-old Ahamed passed away in the wee hours today at RML Hospital here.</p>
<p>The MP from Kerala's Mallapuram suffered a cardiac arrest during the President's address to the joint sitting of Parliament yesterday.</p>
<p>Ahamed's family had alleged that they were not allowed to meet the leader at RML Hospital.</p>
<p>Congress President Sonia Gandhi, party vice president Rahul Gandhi, leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, besides other party leaders had rushed to the hospital late at night and met Ahamed's family.<br /><br /></p>
