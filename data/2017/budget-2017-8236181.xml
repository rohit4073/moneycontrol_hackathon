He maintains September 2017 target of 30,000 on the Sensex.</p>
<p>He says there is significant impact of demonetisation in the near term but interactions suggest things improved towards end-December. He expects multi-speed recovery.</p>
<p>According to him, the timeline for implementation of goods &amp; services tax will likely move from April to July/September 2017 as some issues yet to reach consensus.</p>
<p>Goyal says UP Elections will be keenly watched given the debate and divided public view on demonetisation while in Union Budget, lower personal taxes and higher rural spending are likely.</p>
<p>He feels strong US dollar is likely to be a challenge for emerging markets flows and India's correlation to USD is negative. Domestic flows remain strong.</p>
<p>Key overweights are private sector banks, pharma and industrials while key underweights are materials, IT and consumer staples, Goyal says.</p>]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d01.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2014/356x200/c/citi_356_3431_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2017-01-10 10:43:39</Entry_Date><Category>FII View</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
