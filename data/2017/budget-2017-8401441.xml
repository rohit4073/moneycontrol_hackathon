<p>The exemption covers category I &amp; II investors registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).</p>
<p>In another case where a foreign fund sells its Indian asset and has to return the gains to its investors, &nbsp;Jaitley said the government would issue a clarification exempting such profits also from any tax.</p>
<p>The tax authorities failed to implement the law earlier as the gains had to be calculated as per the last audited balance sheet.</p>
<p>"How do you even implement this -- taxing an entity based in a foreign country? It was impossible to trace them anyway. The exemption is only practical as the authorities could never tax those entities anyway," Anish Thacker, partner of tax and regulatory services at EY India said.&nbsp;</p>]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d01.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2016/356x200/f/FPI_356_3958_356.png]]></Image><Entry_Date>2017-02-01 21:43:27</Entry_Date><Category>Market news</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
