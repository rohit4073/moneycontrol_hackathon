<p>It's been a dream of many an oil expert -- to have a desi oil and gas giant which straddles continents, lords over oil and gas assets and keeps the Indian interests secure. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley might have sown the seeds for such a humongous entity today.</p>
<p>Delivering his 2017-18 Union Budget today, Jaitley said the government proposed "to create an integrated public sector &lsquo;oil major&rsquo; which will be able to match the performance of international and domestic private sector oil and gas companies."</p>
<p>"We see opportunities to strengthen our CPSEs through consolidation, mergers and acquisitions. By these methods, the CPSEs can be integrated across the value chain of an industry. It will give them capacity to bear higher risks, avail economies of scale, take higher investment decisions and create more value for the stakeholders. Possibilities of such restructuring are visible in the oil and gas sector," Jaitley said in his Budget speech.</p>
<p>The government has so far followed a policy that kept oil and gas exploration companies as separate entities from their refining and marketing counterparts.</p>
<p>So while Oil India Ltd and Oil and Natural Gas Corp Ltd explore in India and abroad for oil and gas assets (ONGC overseas through its subsidiary ONGC Videsh), refining and marketing operations are undertaken by Indian Oil Corp Ltd, Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd and GAIL India Ltd.</p>
<p>ONGC subsidiary Mangalore Refinery &amp; Petrochemicals Ltd, as the name suggests, has refining operations.</p>
<p>Examples of such oil and gas behemoths abound. Saudi Arabia's Aramco and Norway's Statoil are among those.</p>]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d03.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2017/356x200/b/Budget_2017_rupee_oil_356x200_2008_356.png]]></Image><Entry_Date>2017-02-01 20:12:40</Entry_Date><Category>Business</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
