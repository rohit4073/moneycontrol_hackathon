<p>However, the ratings agency would still need to see more evidence of the effectiveness of reforms to justify a change in its ratings stance, said Marie Diron, associate managing director of the sovereign rating group at Moody's Investors Service.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley presented a Budget for the fiscal year beginning April 1 that increased spending on rural areas, infrastructure and fighting poverty, but keeping fiscal deficits in check.</p>
<p>"It is a fiscally prudent Budget," Diron said in a phone interview.</p>
<p>"What would potentially lead to an upgrade would be evidence that these reforms that are being implemented are becoming gradually more effective in ensuring a stable and growth environment, and hence lower debt than currently."</p>
<p>Moody's rates India at "Baa3", or its lowest-investment grade, with a "positive" outlook.<br /><br /></p>
