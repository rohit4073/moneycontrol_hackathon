<p>Earlier, <em>Moneycontrol</em>'s <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/economy/budget-2017-jaitley-gives-spendingpush-without-busting-fiscal-bounds_8392381.html" target="_blank">report</a> on the Budget stated that Finance Minister Arun Jaitley placed consumers before rigid fiscal discipline as he spelt out a carefully crafted plan to boost people&rsquo;s spending power, create jobs and improve rural incomes, mixing welfare economics with a new wave of reforms. <br /><br />He offered the most to those at the lowest salary bracket, farmers and small businesses, which endured the demonetisation shock and could also influence the outcome in five upcoming assembly elections.</p>
