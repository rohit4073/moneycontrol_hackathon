<p>He also described Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a "twin brother" of new American President Donald Trump who he said was seen "taking wayward decisions" since ascending to the top chair in the US.</p>
<p>"The Union Budget presented today is bereft of any substance for any section of the society," Prasad told reporters reacting on the budget for 2017-18 presented in Parliament by Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley.</p>
<p>"The minister in his Budget speech did not make any reference as to how many unemployed youths it gave jobs to," the RJD chief asked.</p>
<p>Prasad was particularly harsh for merging of Railway Budget with the General Budget.</p>
<p>"They have demolished the tradition of presentation of separate Rail Budget since Independence... what is the rationale of continuing with a Railway minister when he cannot present the budget of his ministry," Prasad who served as Railway minister during UPA I government, said.</p>
<p>The RJD chief also questioned the NDA government's wisdom of going with presentation of the Budget despite the death of former minister and MP E Ahamed this morning.</p>]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d03.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2014/356x200/l/lalu_prasad_356_4925_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2017-02-01 18:02:04</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
