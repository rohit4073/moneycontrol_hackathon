<p>The review may lead to redefining &ldquo;long term&rdquo; for gains capital gains in stocks to be defined as such, even as tax rates are left unchanged. The holding period is likely to be increased.</p>
<p>Currently, stocks held for more than 12 months are considered a long-term investment. Any long-term gains from transaction in such stocks are exempt from taxes.<br /><br /> Gains from transactions in shares held for less than 12 months are considered short-term capital gains and are subject to 15 percent tax.</p>
