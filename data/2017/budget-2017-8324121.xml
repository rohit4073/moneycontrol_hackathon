<p>There is no illustration to support that the presentation of Union Budget would influence voters' mind in state elections, the top court said while disposing of the PIL filed by advocate ML Sharma.</p>
<div id="adsdiv875x35" class="mnone">The PIL had sought a direction to the Centre for the Budget to be presented in financial year 2017-18 which would commence from April 1, instead of February 1. It had also asked for the central government be restrained from declaring "any relief, programme, financial budget until the states' elections are over" as they would violate the Model Code of Conduct.</div>
<p>The Election Commission had on January 4 come out with the schedule of Assembly elections to be held in five states, including Uttar Pradesh.</p>
<p>Demands to postpone the Budget had also been made by Opposition parties, but the government has maintained that it will present the Budget as scheduled on February 1.</p>]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d01.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2017/356x200/2/2017-01-23T094605Z_1_LYNXMPED0M0HH_RTROPTP_2_INDIA-BUDGET_356.JPG]]></Image><Entry_Date>2017-01-23 15:26:10</Entry_Date><Category>Current Affairs</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
