<p>"The Budget has been along expected lines on most fronts. It has delivered on our expectations of increased spends on infrastructure as well as on agriculture/rural areas. Also, the fiscal deficit has been projected at 3.2&nbsp;percent, which is in line with our expectations of 3.4&nbsp;percent. The Budget has provided relief to lower income assesses by reducing tax rates in the Rs 2.5 lakh &ndash; Rs 5 lakh bracket.</p>
<p>For the markets, the fiscal deficit of 3.2&nbsp;percent is positive as it means interest rates can be lower further during the next fiscal. Also, absence of any changes in capital gains tax is a positive as these apprehensions have been erased. Focus on markets will now shift to the global factors and the remaining quarterly results."</p>
