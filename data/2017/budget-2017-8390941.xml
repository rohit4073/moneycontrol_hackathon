<p>The market seems to be sulking as Union Budget is being read out in the Parliament by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. The Sensex is up 0.03 points&nbsp; at 27655.99, and the Nifty down 9.20 points at 8552.10. About 1313 shares have advanced, 1079 shares declined, and 190 shares are unchanged.</p>
<p>SBI, ITC, Maruti, HDFC and Tata Motors are gainers while TCS, Dr Reddy's, Lupin, Infosys and NTPC are losers in the Sensex.</p>
<p>Presenting the Budget, Jaitley said that the consumer price index inflation is expected to remain within the central bank's mandated range of 2 to 6 percent. "My approach in preparing the Budget is to spend more on rural areas, infrastructure and poverty alleviation with fiscal prudence," he said.</p>
<p>He also added that signs of retreat from globalisation have potential to affect exports from many emerging economies, including India.</p>
