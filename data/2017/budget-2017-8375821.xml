Some experts expect the disclosures to apply on purchases only above Rs 1 lakh.</p>
<p>Currently, customers are required to undergo the know-your-customer compliance for any bullion or jewellery purchases over Rs 2 lakh.</p>
<p>The move is expected largely as a crackdown on unaccounted wealth which is believed to have been converted into jewellery, bullion, and real estate post the government's demonetisation exercise.</p>
<p>Some jewellers also acknowledge that certain constituents in the trade could be exchanging old Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes for gold, and silver to an extent, causing a damage to the industry&rsquo;s repute.</p>
<p>Considering the surge in sales since demonetisation was announced, regulators like the income-tax, Enforcement Directorate and the department of revenue intelligence have already been surveying dealers and jewellers across the country.</p>]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d02.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2014/356x200/a/aadhaar_card_16_9_2022_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2017-01-31 09:00:23</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
