<p>According to global financial services major Bank of America Merrill Lynch, (BofA-ML) the financial year 2017-18 fiscal deficit target is likely to be the same as this fiscal.</p>
<p>"We expect Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to target a fiscal deficit of 3.5 percent of GDP - same as 2016-17 - in 2017-18 in his February 1 Budget, easing the 3 percent target," BofA-ML said in a research note.</p>
<p>Fiscal deficit, the gap between expenditure and revenue for the entire fiscal, has been pegged at Rs 5.33 lakh crore, or 3.5 percent of GDP, in 2016-17.</p>
<p>According to official figures, fiscal deficit touched Rs 4.58 lakh crore, or 85.8 percent of the Budget estimate for the whole financial year, at the end of April-November.</p>
<p>It further noted that given that growth is stagnating at about 4.5 percent in the old GDP series, a relaxation in the fiscal deficit target is likely.</p>
<p>"We have always believed that the Center should relax the fiscal deficit to combat a global recession that is proving to be longer than the Great Depression," BofA-ML added.</p>
<p>Moreover, the committee to review Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act is expected to build in cyclicity in setting fiscal deficit forecasts by switching to a target range of 3-3.5 percent of GDP in 2017-18 from a point target 3 percent, it added.</p>
<p>The report further noted that the Ministry of Finance should net about Rs 1,500 billion from demonetisation.</p>
<p>"After paying for the 7th Pay Commission outgo, PSU bank recapitalisation and a step up in social schemes, the FM will be barely able to fund the Budgeted level of public capital expenditure," the report added.</p>
<p>India remained the fastest growing major economy with its GDP accelerating to 7.3 percent in the July-September quarter, pushed mainly by farm output, although the momentum is expected to be hit in the coming months by the impact of demonetisation.</p>]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d03.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2016/356x200/g/GDP_up_down_india_356x200_5642_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2017-01-06 13:50:05</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
