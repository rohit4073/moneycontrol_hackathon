<p>"The Finance Minister has presented a balanced Budget, underlined by the continued push to using technology to aid a digital economy. As India strengthens its position on the global map, the need for skilled youth is crucial. The Budget&rsquo;s focus on extending market relevant training for the youth and setting up 100 international skill centers across the country, is a positive move. The emphasis on science and technology for students, and launch of SWAYAM, will further empower India&rsquo;s youth for the future."<br /><br />"I am glad to witness the increasing focus on cybersecurity, which is critical to securing the economy&rsquo;s digital transformation. The reduction of corporate tax for MSMEs is a welcome move and will boost the economic growth. The momentum in the implementation of GST is promising and I look forward to seeing it unfold in the coming months."</p>]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d03.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2017/356x200/b/Budget_2017_Budget17_356x200_3456_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2017-02-02 09:20:55</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
