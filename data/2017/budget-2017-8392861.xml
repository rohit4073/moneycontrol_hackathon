<p>Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) will now offer a guaranteed return of 8 percent per annum under a new pension scheme for senior citizens. Finance minister Arun Jaitley in his budget speech said that this scheme will be implemented by the largest public sector insurer in the country.</p>
<p>Currently, as per the regulatory norms, insurance companies are required to offer a non-zero guaranteed return which has to be disclosed upfront at the time of product filing. Hence, returns could vary from one insurer to the other based on their investment strategies.</p>
<p>Senior citizens, who do not have a steady flow of income will be benefitted with the new scheme that will help them earn returns on par with other market instruments. This could also be a direct competition to schemes like National Pension Scheme (NPS).</p>
<p>Being the large insurer with a large investable corpus, LIC, will be able to offer a higher rate of return. It is not yet clear whether other insurers will also be included in this scheme at a later date.</p>
