<p>Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today said that the government will set up strategic crude oil reserves at two more locations -- Chandikhole in Odisha and Rajasthan's Bikaner.</p>
<p>The move will treble India's existing strategic reserve capacity to 15.33 MMT.</p>
<p>"For strengthening our Energy sector, Government has decided to set up Strategic Crude Oil Reserves. In the first phase, 3 such Reserves facilities have been set up. Now in the second phase, it is proposed to set up caverns at 2 more locations," Jaitley said presenting the Union Budget 2017-18.</p>
<p>India already has strategic crude oil reserves with storage capacity of 5.33 MMT at three locations--Visakhapatnam, Mangalore and Padur.</p>
<p>"Some policy announcements with respect of supporting the strengthening of the transmission and distribution network for natural gas could have supported this cause even better," Raju Kumar, Tax Partner, oil and gas at Ernst &amp; Young said.</p>
"The Government continues to push the agenda of building healthy strategic crude reserves and the announcement of adding 2 more caverns for strategic crude storage is a welcome move," he said.]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d02.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2016/356x200/o/oil_gas_356x200_4808_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2017-02-01 21:26:21</Entry_Date><Category>Business</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
