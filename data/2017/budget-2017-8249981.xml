Finance Minister Arun Jaitley may announce a string of initiatives to support the country's start-ups, including widening of the tax-free regime to five years from three years and faster procedural clearances.<br /><br />The move to extend the tax holiday from three years to five years, likely to be announced in Budget 2017-18, will come a year after Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the "Start-Up India" programme in Delhi in January 2016.<br /><br />The other measures expected include: easier exit norms for founders, simpler rules for government supplies; service tax exemption for start-ups; more funds for Atal Innovation Mission likely. The measures, if announced, will act as booster shot for startups that have been hit by wobbly market conditions and valuation markdowns. <br /><br />A study by industry group National Association of Software and Service Companies (Nasscom) and Zinnov Consulting has found out that India has the third-highest number of start-ups in the world (an estimated 4,200-4,400), behind only the US and the UK.<br /><br />]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d02.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2016/356x200/s/startup1_0944_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2017-01-11 20:47:53</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
