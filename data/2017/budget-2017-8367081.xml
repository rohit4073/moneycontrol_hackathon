Steps will be taken to launch dedicated trains for tourism and pilgrimage," the Finance Minister said in his speech.<br /><br />Besides, Jaitley said the service charge on e-tickets booked via IRCTC will be done away with, adding that cashless train ticket bookings had increased to 68%.<br /><br />"Railways will offer competitive ticket booking facility to the public at large. Service charge on e-tickets booked through IRCTC has been withdrawn. Cashless reservations have gone up from 58% to 68%," Jaitley said.<br /><br /><br /><img src="http://www.moneycontrol.com/news_image_files/2017/t/THETRAINPASSENGERSBUDGET_A.jpg" alt="" width="601" height="338" /><br /><br /><img src="http://www.moneycontrol.com/news_image_files/2017/t/THETRAINPASSENGERSBUDGET_B.jpg" alt="" width="599" height="337" /><br /><br /><br />In a first, the government set a&nbsp;unified Budget merging Railway and Union Budget. The Finance Minster's&nbsp;speech on railway budget spanned just 6 minutes, shrinking from&nbsp;120 minutes in the past years.<br /><br />Moneycontrol had last month reported that the government may impose a safety cess to&nbsp;fund the railway safety corpus.

<p>Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu had in December written to Jaitley seeking that the Centre fund the corpus entirely. The Finance Ministry, however, rejected the Railway Ministry&rsquo;s proposal for financing of the new safety fund from the consolidated fund of India.</p>
<p>The Finance Ministry agreed to finance only 25 percent of the fund and has asked the Railways to raise the remaining three-fourths of the required sources for the special corpus.</p>
<p>A Railway Ministry-appointed committee has, in its report, envisaged works of track renewal and upgradation, bridge rehabilitation, elimination of level-crossings, construction of road over bridges/road under bridges, replacement and improvement of signalling system, among others.</p>
