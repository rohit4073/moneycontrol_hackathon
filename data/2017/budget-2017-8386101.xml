Subsidy paid to middle class on gold was second highest paid subsidy at Rs 10,800 crore, after LPG at RS. 28,219 crore. <br /><br />Cost due to this gold subsidy is more than railway subsidy, which the middle class gets from the government. <br /><br />As per the Economic Survey: &ldquo;The top 40 percent population estimated based on <br />expenditure distribution as per NSS data of 2011-12 is assumed to be the &ldquo;middle class&rdquo;. Effective subsidy rate is the difference between normative tax rate (50 per cent for LPG and Aviation turbine fuel, 14 percent service tax for railways and 6 per cent for gold) and actual subsidy/tax rate.&rdquo;<br /><br />After reviewing the Economic Survey, Surendra Mehta, Indian Bullion and Jewelers association National Secretary told Moneycontrol.com &ldquo;We are not expecting any cut in import duty of gold after economic survey and expect GST rate would be around 4%.&rdquo; Earlier, Jewelers associations was expecting 1.25% Goods and service tax (GST) rate for gold. <br /><br />As per economic survey, Gold and silver imports declined by 35.9 per cent this year.
