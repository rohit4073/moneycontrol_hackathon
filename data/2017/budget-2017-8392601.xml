<p>"It was a fairly routine Budget... in the sense that there have not been much changes on the revenue side.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I am happy that the fiscal deficit is maintained at 3.2 percent. The original road map has set it at 3 percent," Rangarajan told CNBC TV18.</p>
<p>"But given the need for expenditure, I suppose some modification on that is okay. I must emphasise the point that changing the road map for reaching the 3 percent fiscal deficit target over the years will make a mockery of the FRBM Act." Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today proposed bringing down fiscal deficit to 3.2 percent of GDP in 2017-18 from 3.5 percent in 2016-17.</p>
<p>"... I have pegged fiscal deficit at 3.2 percent in 2017-18 and remain committed to achieve 3 percent in the following year. With this gradual approach, I have ensured adherence to fiscal consolidation without compromising requirements of public expenditure," Jaitley said in his Budget speech.</p>
<p>Revenue deficit will be reduced to 2.1 percent in 2017-18, from 2.3 percent in 2016-17, the finance minister said.</p>
<p>Net market borrowing will be Rs 3.48 lakh crore in 2017-18, from 4.1 percent in the current fiscal, he said.</p>
