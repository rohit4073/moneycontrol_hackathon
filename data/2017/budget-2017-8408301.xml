A 25 percent higher capital expenditure is sure to give the economy a big growth momentum. Priority to doubling of farm income and rural development makes it a balanced and inclusive Budget. <br />&nbsp;<br />The focus on rural sector, large allocation of Rs 3.96 lakh crore for infrastructure development and social spending are welcome moves. New dispute resolution mechanism for quick dispute settlements and abolishing FIPB will improve the ease of investing in India along with the push on digital that will bring in efficiency and eradicate corruption. Addressing arsenic and fluoride menace in 28,000 villages gives the Budget a human touch while reducing corporate tax rate by 25 percent for MSME and the move to curb cash donations for political funding are very good moves."]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d03.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2017/356x200/b/Budget_2017_356x200_4046_356.png]]></Image><Entry_Date>2017-02-02 14:51:22</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
