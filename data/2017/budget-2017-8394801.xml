<p>The subsidy bill on food, petroleum and fertilisers is estimated at Rs 2,40,338.6 crore for 2017-18 fiscal, according to the Budget proposals presented by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in Parliament.</p>
<p>The subsidy bill is seen at Rs 2,32,704.68 crore for 2016-17 financial year, as per the revised Budget estimates.</p>
<p>The government has earmarked Rs 1,45,338.60 crore for food subsidy in the next fiscal as against Rs 1,35,172.96 crore in the revised estimate of this fiscal.</p>

<p>Fertiliser subsidy has been kept unchanged at Rs 70,000 crore for 2017-18 fiscal, even as the domestic industry was demanding higher allocation to clear subsidy arrears of about Rs 35,000 crore.</p>
<p>In fertiliser subsidy, the government has allocated Rs 49,768 crore for urea and Rs 20,232 crore for decontrolled phosphoric and potassic (P&amp;K) fertilisers.</p>
