<p>"The issue is with affordability. People should be able to buy them. Right now in India, only 10 percent market is of inverters, while in China it is 75 percent," the official said.</p>
<p>Another point he raised was of foreign brands competing with Indian companies.<br /><br /> "How will the domestic market grow? For 'Make in India' our products have to be cheaper, otherwise we will not be able to compete with China," Thiagarajan said. <br /><br />The company estimates that the AC market would grow by 15 percent in the coming fiscal and their own market share would increase to 12 percent from 10.5 percent.</p>
<p>For Blue Star, their 50 percent of sales comes from tier three, four and five cities and towns. <br /><br />"In northern India, our market share is 7.5 percent. It is because it is a very price sensitive market, demand for windows ACs and weak distribution network. Now we are increasing our focus in the north," he said adding they want to be the number one player in the inverter segment in India.</p>]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d03.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2015/356x200/b/blue_star_3724_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2016-02-03 18:42:35</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><sc_id>,BS,</sc_id><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
