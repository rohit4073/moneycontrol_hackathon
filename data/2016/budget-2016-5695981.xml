<p>The Sensex is up 49.15 points or 0.2 percent at 23203.45 and the Nifty is up 21.75 points or 0.3 percent at 7051.50. About 1133 shares have advanced, 1184 shares declined, and 152 shares are unchanged.</p>
<p>Sandeep Upadhyay MD &amp; CEO, Centrum Infrastructure Advisory says, "It is evident that the Government continuous to focus on re-fuelling investments in Infrastructure with a high priority on Transportation sector."</p>
<p>"The concerted efforts so far to get stranded Road projects back on track certainly seems to have a positive impact though I believe for the next couple of years large part of the development funding in Infrastructure sector would still have to be incurred on the Government's balance sheet rather than Private sector."<br /><br /><em>Posted by Nasrin Sultana</em><br /><em>Follow @<a href="https://twitter.com/NasrinzStory">NasrinzStory</a></em></p>]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d01.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2016/356x200/b/Budget2016_SENSEX_BSE_NSE_Stock_Market_356x200_2415_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2016-02-29 14:10:13</Entry_Date><Category>Local Markets</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
