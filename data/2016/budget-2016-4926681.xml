Under GST they will have to register in all locations where their software is used, said Shah, adding that it will be challenging to compute tax liability for B2B and B2C transactions. <br /><br />Another issue said Shah is that a lot of software companies are located in SEZs and STPIs and most of their software exports are zero-rated. So, they go by refund mechanism or there is an exemption for some of the services that they consume.&nbsp; Probably under GST, exemptions maybe moved to refund mechanism. This will impact working capital requirements and may also raise effective tax rate, he added.<br /><br />Shah also said, currently VAT on software is 5 percent and under GST, if there is no p referential rate for software then the tax burden will be higher.<br /><br />For more details on the impact of GST on IT sector, watch video]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d02.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2015/356x200/g/GST_shutterstock_356x200_0826_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2016-01-08 16:43:13</Entry_Date><Category>Business</Category><Video_flag>1</Video_flag></article></news>
