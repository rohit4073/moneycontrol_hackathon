A focus on rural incomes and an increase in allocation to the MNREGA scheme signals a more inclusive approach to economic development. The negatives include a lower bank recapitalisation allocation, increased taxation on autos and no major tax reforms. However emphasis has been on ensuring continuity in fiscal consolidation, correcting non-uniform tax subsidies and achieving social empowerment. I rate this Budget a 4 on a possible scale of 5 points, 5 being the best, given difficult domestic demand and uncertain international events". <br /> <br /> <em><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: The above views is of Tushar Pradhan in his individual capacity and not of HSBC Mutual Fund.</em>]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d02.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2016/356x200/b/Budget2016_economy_growth_GDP_356x200_2811_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2016-02-29 17:37:31</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
