<p>As per the survey presented by the Chief Economic Advisor, the impact of global volatilities on India is likely to be less than other emerging economies. However, growth could face considerable headwinds if global demand remains weak.</p>
<p>A spike in oil prices may drag consumption and hurt monetary easing prospects, the survey says, adding exports slow down may continue for a while before picking up in FY17.</p>
<p>On the current stress faced by the domestic banking sector, the survey says underlying stressed assets in corporate sector must be sold or rehabilitated. <br /><br />Accordingly, certain non-financial assets could be sold off to recapitalise public sector banks. Earlier, the minister of state for finance Jayant Sinha had said power has been given to banks to recover money from debt-ridden promoters.&nbsp;</p>]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d02.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2016/356x200/e/ECONOMIC_SURVEY_economy_busget2016_356x200.jpg_2543_356.png]]></Image><Entry_Date>2016-02-26 11:59:13</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
