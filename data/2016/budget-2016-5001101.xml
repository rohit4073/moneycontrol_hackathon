CNBC-TV18 learns that the ministry may seek revision of basic customs duty between 10-25 percent, where the tax levied on long products would be 10 percent and on flat and stainless steel products would be 15 percent. <br /><br />The ministry&nbsp;recommends increasing the peak duty rate from 15 percent to 25 percent and basic custom duty on alloy steel products should be 25 percent. This development comes in the light of low steel products pricing from China, Japan and Korea, which is hurting the industry.<br /><br />Other recommendations from the ministry include reduction on royalty for minerals and may ask to keep district mineral fund (DMF) in abeyance till the policy is in place. It is likely to push for low input cost, cheaper raw material and viability of gas based steel plants.<br /><br />In addition, ministers may seek waiver of import duty on limestone, zero&nbsp;percent on import of iron ore fines and lumps and removal of import duty on coking coal which is currently at 2.5 percent.<br /><br /><em><strong>Watch video for more</strong></em>]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d03.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2015/356x200/s/steel-30-09-2015-356_1409_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2016-01-14 12:39:57</Entry_Date><Category>CNBC-TV18 Comments</Category><Video_flag>1</Video_flag></article></news>
