<p>The government further plans to open 62 new Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya&rsquo;s and start a digital literacy scheme for rural India.</p>
<p>In last year's Budget,&nbsp;allocation to the education sector including mid-day meals was trimmed to Rs 68,968 crore from Rs 70,505 crore allotted in the previous budget.</p>
<p>A higher Budget for basic education may not necessarily be the answer to India&rsquo;s problem of low adult literacy rates compared to other BRICS nations. <br /><br />Despite government spending on education having more than doubled over the last decade, the system is suffering from poorly trained teachers, (and consequently quality of teaching) and a high drop-out rate among the poor.</p>
