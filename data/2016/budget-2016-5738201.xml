<p>More than 3 lakh jewellers participated in the strike on Day 1, an industry body claimed.</p>
<p>"Over 300 associations, that consists of over 3 lakh manufacturers, retainers, artisans among others, participated in the stir across the country. The strike has been 100 percent successful," All India Gems and Jewellery Trade Federation (GJF) Chairman Sreedhar G V told PTI.</p>
<p>Sreedhar said the gems and jewellery industry has been forced to go on strike due to the government's apathy towards the sector reflected in the proposal to re-impose 1 percent excise duty in the Union Budget presented by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on February 29.</p>
<p>"We were already facing challenges and businesses have gone down by 25-30 percent after the Government's decision in January to make PAN cards mandatory for any transaction of Rs 2 lakh and above. Instead of increasing the slab to Rs 10 lakh from Rs 2 lakh and reducing the customs duty to 2 percent from 10 percent, the Government has created more difficulties by re-introducing 1 percent excise duty," he rued.</p>
<p>He said in 2005 and 2012, the Centre had introduced 1 percent excise duty in the gems and jewellery sector, but had to drop the move as it was not deemed practical with the industry comprising mostly under-educated but highly skilled people who are not equipped to handle the paper work required for it.</p>
<p>Jaitley proposed 1 percent excise duty on jewellery without input credit or 12.5 percent with input tax credit on jewellery, excluding silver other than studded with diamonds and some other precious stones.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a GJF delegation plans to meet Finance Ministry officials with a representation to explain difficulties faced by the industry with these measures. Sreedhar said jewellers will take a call on future course of action after their meeting with the officials.</p>
<p>The size of domestic industry is estimated to be around Rs 3.15 lakh crore with the potential to grow to Rs 5 lakh crore by 2018.</p>]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d03.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2016/356x200/b/Budget2016_India_GDP_Growth_inflation_rise_economy_gold_jwellery_356x200_3741_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2016-03-03 08:34:08</Entry_Date><Category>Current Affairs</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
