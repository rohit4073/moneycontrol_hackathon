<p>Issues concerning implementation of the 14th Finance Commission recommendations are also likely to figure during the meeting with the states. <br /><br />The 14th Finance Commission had last year recommended a record 10 percent increase in the states' share in the Union taxes to 42 percent, which has been accepted by the Centre. However, certain states raised concerns about its implementation.</p>
<p>As regards GST, the Centre is hopeful of getting it approved in the ensuing Budget session of Parliament beginning February 23. <br /><br />However, the Congress party, which is vehemently opposing the bill, is yet to come on board. <br /><br />The Constitution Amendment Bill has been approved by the Lok Sabha but is yet to get the green signal from the Rajya Sabha when the ruling NDA does not have a majority.</p>
<p>GST would usher in a new indirect tax regime which would subsume levies such as excise, service and local taxes. <br /><br />As part of the pre-budget consultative process, Jaitley had earlier held meetings with various stakeholders including industry chambers, economists, trade unions and financial institutions.</p>]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d02.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2016/356x200/b/budget_2016_4_356X200_2919_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2016-02-05 16:40:26</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
