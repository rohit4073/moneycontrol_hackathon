However, increases in cross subsidy and additional surcharges for purchasing electricity from power exchanges, have acted as significant barriers, though the move has helped state-owned power distribution companies (DISCOMs).<br /><br />"The power generation capacity has increased while the financial ability of discoms to purchase electricity has diminished,&rdquo; the Survey said, adding that the time was now ripe to allow industries with higher power demands to absorb excess generation capacity through "Open Access".<br /><br />The Survey also said that India&rsquo;s domestic power tariff schedules have greater scope for progressive pricing.<br /><br />It has proposed that tariffs for the poor can be reduced while covering costs and without unduly burdening those better off. <br /><br />"Cross-subsidization will occur within the residential consumers itself &ndash; i.e. rich consumers with high consumption intensity within the residential sectors subsidise prices for consumers with lower consumption due to differential demand price elasticities," the Survey said.]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d03.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2015/356x200/p/power-transmission-356_5534_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2016-02-26 13:27:48</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
