I am also glad to see the attention being paid towards building infrastructure especially roads. The infrastructure sector creates highest employment and is imperative for the growth of our country. The government&rsquo;s focus on start-ups and entrepreneurs is also commendable. <br /><br />The budget presented must be perceived in the context of global economic uncertainties. Commitment towards fiscal consolidation and dispute resolution will send a strong signal to the global investors. These measures will help in tax predictability and improve ease of doing business. The outlook for cement sector looks bright with more than 75 percent of stalled projects put on track and boosting investment in the housing and infrastructure sectors.]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d02.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2016/356x200/b/Budget_farmers_agriculture_bullock_2016_rural_fertiliser_growth_356x200_1821_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2016-02-29 18:36:14</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
