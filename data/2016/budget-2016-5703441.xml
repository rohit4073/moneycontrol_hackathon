<p>&ldquo;It is no doubt a political budget, partly aimed at correcting a perception that the government is urban-centric. Focus areas are clearly agriculture, villages and infrastructure.

We all should welcome the fact that tobacco is more expensive now. All this augurs well for the economy in general.&rdquo;</p>]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d02.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2016/356x200/b/Budget2016_SENSEX_BSE_NSE_Stock_Market_up_356x200_2309_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2016-02-29 18:21:55</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
