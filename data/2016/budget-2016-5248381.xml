<span id="midArticle_1"></span>
<p>Jaitley is staring at a big revenue shortfall as India again misses an unrealistic target for raising cash from selling off state assets, while sliding commodity prices and exports have dented revenues.</p>
<span id="midArticle_2"></span>
<p>His boss, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has questioned whether businesses should continue to benefit from tax "incentives" worth 624 billion rupees (USD 9.2 billion) that he described as subsidies in all but name.</p>
<span id="midArticle_3"></span>
<p>"My aim is not to eliminate subsidies, but to rationalise and target them," Modi said in a keynote speech last week.</p>
<span id="midArticle_4"></span>
<p>Those familiar with the Budget process said Jaitley may pare tax breaks on capital investment, research and development, and projects in under-developed regions. As of now, the government is not considering raising its deficit target.</p>
<span id="midArticle_5"></span>
<p>They declined to estimate how much those measures would raise, but one said they would more than offset revenue losses from cuts in India's corporate income tax announced a year ago.</p>
<span id="midArticle_6"></span>
<p>Then, Jaitley promised to bring down the tax to 25 percent from 30 percent over four years, pruning exemptions as he goes.</p>
<span id="midArticle_7"></span>
<p>Businesses have hailed the promised tax cuts but they, and their advisers, say closing loopholes too aggressively would hamper Modi's "Make in India" drive to attract foreign investors and boost export industries.</p>
<span id="midArticle_8"></span>
<p>"If Mr. Modi is talking about Make in India, it has to be the foreign multinational companies setting up manufacturing facilities in India and using it as an export hub like China," said Rahul Mitra, a tax partner at KPMG. "If you want to do that you can't wish away the necessary exemptions for exports."</p>]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d03.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2015/356x200/a/arun_jaitley_356x200_2924_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2016-02-01 21:24:25</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
