<p>According to industry estimates, total capital requirement of the 23 state-owned banks with nearly 73 percent of assets among them, would shoot up to approximately Rs 180,000 crore by FY19.</p>
<p>To ease the pressure, the government recently announced a plan to infuse Rs 70,000 crore into public sector banks (PSBs) over the four years leading up to FY19.&nbsp; This amount will be split into four tranches of 25,000 crore each for the current and next fiscal and Rs 10,000 crore each for the following two fiscals.</p>
<p>However, the catch is that the infusion will restrict access to fresh capital infusion for poorly managed banks.</p>
<p>Accordingly, it is expected that the budget 2015-16 would see Rs 25,000 crore allocated for recapitalisation. However, it remains to be seen whether the promised funding will actually happen.</p>
<p>This also needs to be seen in context of the previous budgeted allocations. In 2014-15, the government ended up infusing only about Rs 6,990 crore, compared to the budgeted Rs 11,200 crore. Similarly, despite the mounting worry, the initial budgeted allocation for 2015-16 was only Rs 7,940 crore</p>]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d01.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2014/356x200/i/investment-saving-money-banking_slide_1752_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2016-02-08 12:48:31</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
