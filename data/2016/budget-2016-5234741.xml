<p>"As markets stabilise, we expect the Reserve Bank to keep the rates on hold on February 2. After a total of 125 bps rate cuts in 2015, the benchmark Repo rate is likely to be held at 6.75 percent and reverse repo rate at 5.75 percent," it said in a report on the Indian economy.</p>
<p>"Reserve ratios will be left unchanged, we reckon. We see room for a 25 bps cut in March or April if the 2016-17 Budget satisfies the central bank on the government's fiscal consolidation efforts. (A March cut would be an inter-meeting decision)," it said.</p>
<p>Inflation is still within January 2016 targets, but faces upward risks as CPI inflation has been inching up since the third quarter of 2015. From a low of 3.9 percent year-on-year in the September quarter, inflation rose to more than a year's high at 5.6 percent by December, noted the bank.</p>
<p>Core inflation, while still benign, has also tracked the uptrend, it added.</p>
<p>Other price indicators, for instance WPI inflation and PMI sub-indices are also off recent lows, said the bank.</p>
<p>"The disinflationary impact of low crude prices was more than offset by a sharp jump in food price pressures and were not helped by adverse base effects," it pointed out.</p>
<p>Service sector inflation remains sticky and indeed rose to 4 percent year-on-year from 3.1 percent in the September quarter.</p>
<p>Despite the recent increase, the inflation outlook appears manageable, said the bank with a growing presence in the Indian market.</p>
<p>The RBI's inflation target of 6 percent for January 2016 is unlikely to be breached, it said.</p>]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d01.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2015/356x200/r/Reserve_bank_of_India_RBI_356x200_5206_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2016-02-01 11:35:03</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
