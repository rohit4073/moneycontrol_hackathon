<p>Reacting to the Budget proposals here, the Chief Minister was all praise for the goal to double the income of farmers in five years and the provision of Rs 35,984 crore for their welfare.</p>

<p>Besides, the proposals to have a unified agriculture market e-platform, allocation of the highest-ever Rs 38,500 crore to MNREGA and the target of 100 percent rural electrification by May 1, 2018 are highly appreciable.</p>
<p>Mixing fiscal prudence with sagacious use of resources at his command, Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has given infrastructure the much needed boost with the allocation of Rs 2.31 lakh crore, including Rs 97,000 crore for roads for building 10,000 km of national highways in 2016-17 and conversion of 50,000 km of state highways to national highways, he said.</p>
<p>The allocation of Rs 500 crore for Stand Up India Scheme for members belonging to SCs/ STs and women entrepreneurs, proposal to promote two projects under Stand Up India per bank branch per category, opening 1,500 multi-skill training institutes and to skill one crore youth in the next three years under the PM Kaushal Vikas Yojana, and Rs 1,000 crore for higher education financing would help skill the youth and get them employment, the Chief Minister said.</p>
<p>Appreciating an allocation of Rs 9,500 crore for 'Swacch Bharat Abhiyan', proposal to cover six crore additional households under digital literacy scheme in the next three years, he said the decision to set up 300 urban clusters under Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Rurban Mission would help change the urban landscape in the country.</p>]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d03.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/default/Budget12_356x200.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2016-02-29 16:58:03</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
