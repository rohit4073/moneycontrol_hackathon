<p>&ldquo;The Indian government&rsquo;s vision of &lsquo;Transforming India&rsquo; was very well articulated in today&rsquo;s budget speech of Finance Minister. On one hand the measures announced in agriculture, rural and healthcare sectors will increase the confidence of rural India while on the other financial and tax reforms will increase the confidence of investors. Besides, the government&rsquo;s focus on skill development, job creation, infrastructure development and higher education will help create more job opportunities.</p>
<p>From a common man's perspective too, the budget has presented some good news. Measures such as increase in HRA and lesser tax burden on individuals with income less than Rs 5 lakh will surely be welcomed.</p>
<p>The government&rsquo;s impetus on increasing the efficiency and modernizing of ports and improving the road infrastructure will definitely provide a fillip to our sector. Overall this is a realistic budget with more focus on rural and infrastructure development while keeping the fiscal deficit in check.&rdquo;</p>]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d01.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2016/356x200/b/Budget2016_Arun_Jaitley_budget_FM_budget_Finance_356x200_4344_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2016-02-29 18:36:11</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
