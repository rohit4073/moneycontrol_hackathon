We do welcome the government&rsquo;s acknowledgement of the role start-ups play in job creation, and the tax holiday for the first three&nbsp;years of starting a company. We expect the real estate sector to benefit from the government's focus on the infrastructure sector, notably roads and highways, and its promise of a new more effective credit rating system of infra projects that will enable high quality projects to attract more funding. The digitisation of land records under the integrated land management system will go a long way in simplifying land acquisition for projects. The government's service tax exemption on houses less than 60 suare metre, and the additional exemption of Rs 50,000 for housing loans up to Rs 35 lakhs for homes not above Rs 50 lakhs will both likely improve first-time home buyers' sentiment."]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d01.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2015/356x200/h/housing_budgethousing_2851_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2016-02-29 15:02:09</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
