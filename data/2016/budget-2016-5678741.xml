The Sensex is down 74.47 points or 0.3 percent at 23079.83, and the Nifty is down 20.45 points or 0.3 percent at 7009.30. About 779 shares have advanced, 841 shares declined, and 79 shares are unchanged.
<p>SBI, ICICI Bank, Tata Steel, ONGC and Dr Reddy's are top gainers while Hero, GAIL, HUL, Bajaj Auto and Maruti are losers in the Sensex.</p>
<p>As Finance Minister Arun Jaitley presents Union Budget today, the market will focus on credibility of numbers. Investors will be keen to know if the govt deviates from the fiscal consolidation roadmap in order to boost growth. The other big fear the market has is the possible extension of the long term capital gains tax tenure from 1 to 3 years or the possibility of reintroduction of a tax itself.</p>
