The Budget is leaning more towards rural consumption, which in light of consecutive bad monsoons steps will bolster the India consumption story which is reliant on rural consumption. As expected, the Budget has laid emphasis on infrastructure especially roads, it is also about higher taxation for the elite class and effective utilisation of the same proceeds towards the growth and development story of India."</p>
<p>"Fiscal deficit target of 3.5 percent is a big plus for the economy as well as for the equity and bond markets. However, there is a need to review the medium term fiscal framework, in light of the significant changes in growth and inflation outlooks across the world."</p>
<p>"The question which is worrying is the uptake of the private sector capital expenditure which will hopefully pick up in the coming months. Higher STT on options could be a cause of concern as it pushes up the cost for derivative participants."</p>]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d01.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2016/356x200/b/Budget2016_SENSEX_BSE_NSE_Stock_Market_up_356x200_2309_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2016-02-29 17:37:11</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
