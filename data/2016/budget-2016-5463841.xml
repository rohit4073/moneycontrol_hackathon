<p>According to the global financial services major, the implementation of the 7th Pay Commission recommendations should support consumption demand in the country but would limit planned expenditure.</p>
<p>"In response, we expect the RBI to cut rates by 25 bps on April 5 as the fiscal deficit is already low compared to history," BofA-ML said in a research note.</p>
<p>Reserve Bank Governor Raghuram Rajan on February 2 left key interest rate unchanged citing inflation risks and growth concerns, while pegging further easing of monetary policy on government's budget proposals.</p>
<p>Rajan said RBI "continues to be accommodative" but would look forward to the government's budget proposals on February 29 as also the inflation trend.</p>
<p>BofA-ML expects Budget 2016-17 to target a fiscal deficit of 3.8 per cent of GDP, a tad lower than financial year 2015-16's 3.9 per cent, but higher than the pre-committed 3.5 per cent.</p>
<p>As per the revised fiscal consolidation roadmap, the government proposes to bring down fiscal deficit from 3.9 per cent in the current fiscal to 3.5 per cent in 2016-17.</p>
<p>According to official figures, fiscal deficit -- gap between the government's expenditure and revenue -- in the nine months of 2015-16 worked out to 88 per cent of the annual target as against 100.2 per cent in the same period last fiscal.</p>
<p>The improvement was mainly on account of buoyancy in tax collections, which have kept revenue deficit in check.</p>
<p>According to the global brokerage firm, Budget 2016 will seek to balance growth and fiscal consolidation.</p>
<p>"We expect Finance Minister Jaitley to walk the tightrope between supporting growth and fiscal credibility on February 29," the report noted.</p>]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d01.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2015/356x200/i/interest_rates_4132_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2016-02-14 11:48:11</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
