<p>"Total additional exports of Rs 7,500 crore in 2016-17 are envisaged by the incentives announced in this Budget," Apparel Export Promotion Council Chairman Ashok G Rajani said.</p>
<p>He said the addition of 1 percent Free on Board (FOB) value of exports in custom duty for specified fabrics would enable garment exporters to undertake production where they were not competitive.</p>
<p>"In the year 2016-17, fabrics worth around Rs 1,000 crore (1 percent of Rs 1 lakh crore) would be eligible for imports and custom duty of Rs 110 crore would be saved by garment exporters.</p>
<p>"This will give avenues for new product development. It would provide additional exports of Rs 2,500 crore in a complete year," Rajani said.</p>
<p>Besides, the continuation of duty free import of trimmings and embellishments to the extent of 5 percent of FOB would give additional garment export of Rs 5,000 crore in 2016-17, he said.</p>]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d01.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2015/356x200/t/tailorgarments356_3001_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2016-03-02 08:14:05</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
