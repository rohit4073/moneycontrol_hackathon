Further, Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana will be implemented in mission mode where 28.5 lakh hectares will be brought under irrigation. Here 89 irrigation projects, which were languishing for a long time, will be fast-tracked. <br /><br />According to the government plans, a dedicated Long Term Irrigation Fund will be created in National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) with an initial corpus of about Rs 20,000 crore. <br /><br />Another programme for sustainable management of ground water resources will be given an estimated cost of Rs 6,000 crore and will be implemented through multilateral funding. Additional 5 lakh farm ponds and dug wells in rain fed areas and 10 lakh compost pits for production of organic manure will be taken up under MGNREGA. <br /><br />There has been a spate of farmer suicides because of two consecutive years of drought. <br /><br />Bank loans, the only respite for farmers who need them to buy seeds and fertilizers, aren't enough. Hence, acquiring irrigation equipment, increasing the irrigation cover, introducing more such sustainable micro-irrigation schemes and pushing for rainwater harvesting and storage practices became the only bulwark against drought.</p>]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d02.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2016/356x200/b/Budget2016_economy_growth_GDP_356x200_2811_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2016-02-29 11:42:05</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
