<p>According to the Japanese brokerage firm, gross value added (GVA) growth has marginally undershot the RBI's 7.4 percent projection in the financial year 2015-16, supporting the case for a rate cut.</p>
<p>"In our baseline, we believe the RBI will cut the repo rate by 25 bps in the April policy meeting after the Budget.</p>
<p>Beyond that, we expect the RBI to stay on hold and shift its focus to policy transmission," it said in a research note.</p>
<p>The quality and quantum of fiscal consolidation and supportive structural reforms in the Budget are now key to watch, it added.</p>
<p>The global brokerage firm reported that though the GDP data suggests that India's growth cycle has accelerated in the financial year 2015-16, driven primarily by rising private consumption demand and steady public investment growth, there remains a "disconnect between GDP and real data".</p>
<p>According to data of the Central Statistics Office (CSO), the economy is expected to grow at a 5-year high of 7.6 percent in the current fiscal.</p>
<p>The CSO data showed that the economy grew at 7.6 percent in the first quarter, 7.7 percent in second and 7.3 percent in third.</p>
<p>"We expect GDP (market prices) growth to pick up moderately to 7.8 percent in FY17 (year ending March 2017) from 7.6 percent in FY16, indicating a slow and steady upcycle," Nomura said.</p>
<p>The factors that are likely to support growth recovery include low commodity prices, low inflation, wage hikes owing to the forthcoming 7th pay commission and a normal monsoon.</p>
<p>However, "the pace of recovery is likely to be slow, because of weak private sector investment and stagnant external demand," it added.</p>]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d01.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2015/356x200/r/Reserve_bank_of_India_RBI_356x200_5206_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2016-02-10 14:58:03</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
