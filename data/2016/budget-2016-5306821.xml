I am not pessimistic like others ...I am optimistic that GST, real estate development bill and bankruptcy bill will be passed during this session," he told reporters on the sidelines of India Investment Summit here.<br /><br /> The minister also appealed to the opposition parties, especially Congress, to let the Parliament approve these legislations as they were in the larger interest of the country.<br /><br /> "I appeal to all parties...that as the country is moving forward, we need these legislations in the larger interest of the country. I appeal to them and I seek their cooperation for passing these legislations in the budget session," Naidu said. <br /><br />The Congress has stalled the passage of the constitution amendment Bill in the Rajya Sabha, derailing the government's plan to roll out GST from April 1, 2016. </p>
<p>"We are already in touch (with Congress) and we have been in touch (and) we will be in touch in future also. There is a regular interaction which we have with other friendly parties. "Even about the (timing of the budget) session, I have consulted lot of our senior opposition party leaders and we continue our interaction with them," Naidu said. </p>
<p>On the three demands of Congress with regard to the GST bill, he said: "We have already addressed these issues...and the same has been communicated to the Congress party."<br /><br /> The three demands are a cap on the GST rate in the Constitution itself, removal of the proposed 1 percent additional tax on inter-state movement of goods and setting up a judicial panel to adjudicate disputes among states. Budget Session of Parliament commences on February 23. While the first part of the session will end on March 16, the second part will be take place from April 25 to May 13. </p>]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d01.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2015/356x200/g/GST_shutterstock_356x200_0826_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2016-02-04 15:07:34</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
