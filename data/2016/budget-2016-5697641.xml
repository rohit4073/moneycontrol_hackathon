<p>ONGC, BHEL, Maruti, Infosys and L&amp;T were major losers while ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Reliance, SBI and Dr Reddy's Labs were major gainers in the Sensex.</p>
<p>Standard &amp; Poor's retained its sovereign rating on India despite the government sticking to its fiscal deficit target in Monday's Budget as it waited for further improvement in public finances.</p>
<p>S&amp;P said it would wait for the government to improve its net debt and fiscal consolidation and does not expect to change India's BBB- rating with a 'stable' outlook until next year.</p>
<p>"The government's debt burden and subsidy spending continue to significantly constrain its fiscal policy options," Standard &amp; Poor's credit analyst Kyran Curry said in a statement.</p>
<p>"Interest payments and subsidies account for almost 40percent of total budgetary expenditure."</p>]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d03.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2016/356x200/s/Sensex_BSE_Nifty_Arun_jaitley_down_Stock_markets_Dalal_Street_356x200_2604_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2016-02-29 15:37:07</Entry_Date><Category>Local Markets</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
