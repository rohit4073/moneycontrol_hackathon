<p>&ldquo;The Budget announced this year is a progressive budget and indicated the Government's desire to move towards higher GDP. Thrust on infrastructure and affordable housing is commendable. Greater outlay for&nbsp;construction of road and highways is a definite positive. We may see a lot of traction in the affordable housing space with finance ministry announce a 100 percent deduction in tax on profits and service tax exemption for companies creating apartment upto 60 sq meters.<br /><br /> Additionally, digitisation of land records will help in more transparent sale and market-based pricing of land and&nbsp;additional exemption of Rs 50,000 for houses under Rs 50 lakhs will help bring in first buyers to the market.&rdquo;</p>]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d02.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2016/356x200/b/Budget2016_Sensex_Nifty_bse_nse_stock_markets_356x200_4118_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2016-02-29 18:36:14</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
