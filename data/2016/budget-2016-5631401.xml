]]></Summary><Body><![CDATA[<strong><em>Below is snapview of the state of capital goods industry by CRISIL Research</em></strong><br /><br /><strong>Healthy growth foreseen</strong><br /><br />▪ Domestic formulation sales are expected to grow by 13-14% in the next fiscal, aided by strong growth in chronic care therapies and minimal impact from expected pricing interventions <br /><br />▪ Pharmaceutical exports (API and formulations) are expected to sustain 10-11% growth in the next fiscal. Strong US sales are likely to offset increased regulatory scrutiny and currency headwinds in markets such as Europe, and Latin America.<br /><br /><strong>Margin to remain range-bound</strong> <br /><br />▪ Operating margin of formulation companies is likely to be range-bound (large companies 24-25% and mid-sized 18-20%) next fiscal. Margin expansion, due to improved export realisations, will be limited by a rise in research and development (R&amp;D) and compliance costs.<br /><br />▪ Margins of bulk drug players are also likely to remain range-bound (17-19%) next fiscal largely on account of pricing pressures, which will limit the benefit of improved volumes.]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d02.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2016/356x200/c/CRISILLOGO_2_356_1907_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2016-02-24 18:09:30</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
