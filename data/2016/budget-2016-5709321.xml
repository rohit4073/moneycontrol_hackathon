<p>"As far as GST is concerned, every political party claims to be in favour of it. The Congress party had put some conditions. I think one condition still remains there. I will try to talk to them in the remaining of the Budget session of Parliament, and try to move ahead with the GST bill", Jaitley said in a post Budget Hackathon.</p>
<p>Jaitley said the proposed Goods and Services Tax (GST) is the need of the hour and it has the capability to strengthen the Indian economy.</p>
<p>"It is simple, will help in expansion of revenue, states will get benefit out of it, business will have ease and it will facilitate seamless transfer of goods and services.</p>
<p>"GST will help in making the whole country in one single market, it means one-sixth of world market is one market. You won't get a bigger market than this elsewhere", Jaitley said.</p>]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d03.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2015/356x200/g/gst-356_2700_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2016-02-29 21:52:03</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
