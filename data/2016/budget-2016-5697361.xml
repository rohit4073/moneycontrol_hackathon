No change in individual slabs, POEM deferral, GARR confirmation, &nbsp;action point on BEPS master file and country by country report,&nbsp; road map to reduction to lower tax rates and phase out of exemptions along expected lines.&nbsp; Introduction of&nbsp; Amnesty scheme can be questioned.&nbsp; <br /><br />Further, many provisions to build confidence with the tax payers with a view to reduce litigations and commitment to no retrospective amendment.&nbsp;All in all,&nbsp; in the backdrop of the prevailing global scenario, Budget 2016 a good pragmatic balancing act.</p>]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d01.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2016/356x200/b/Budget2016_SENSEX_BSE_NSE_Stock_Market_up_356x200_2309_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2016-02-29 15:35:15</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
