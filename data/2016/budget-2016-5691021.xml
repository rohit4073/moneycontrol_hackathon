Stocks like <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/transportlogistics/interglobeaviation/IA04">InterGlobe Aviation</a>, <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/transportlogistics/jetairways/JA01">Jet Airways</a> and <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/transportlogistics/spicejet/SJ01">SpiceJet</a> are down 4-6 percent intraday on Monday. Investors are scared that a 5 percent customs duty on crude may be re-imposed in the Union Budget to be presented by the Finance Minister Arun Jaitley.</p>
<p>An association of companies has requested the government not to reimpose customs duty on crude oil saying that refineries will not be able to absorb additional costs.</p>
<p>With international oil prices slumping to 12-year low, it is being said that the government may, in the Budget next week, look at re-imposing 5 percent customs duty on crude oil imports to shore up its revenue by around Rs 18,000 crore.</p>
<p>The government had cut customs duty on crude oil imports to zero from 5 percent in June 2011 when rates zoomed to over USD 100 per barrel. But with oil prices hovering at USD 30 a barrel now, the duty may be brought back.</p>]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d01.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2015/356x200/a/Airlines_aeroplane_air_lines_356x200_5333_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2016-02-29 10:17:40</Entry_Date><Category>Buzzing Stocks</Category><sc_id>,IA05,JA01,ML04,</sc_id><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
