Progress on this front has been limited so far. The one-time black money compliance window netted barely Rs 3800 crore in 638 declarations. The government has sworn "action" against those who have not disclosed unaccounted assets abroad. Some stringent measures towards this end can be expected in the Budget<br /><br />In addition to offense, the FM may also work on defense measures to curb black money through measures to boost cashless transactions. These could include scrapping of convenience fee charged by government departments, slashing merchant discount rate on card transactions, and incentives to promote mobile banking.</p>]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d02.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2015/356x200/m/moneymoneymoney_2519_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2016-02-08 12:51:06</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
