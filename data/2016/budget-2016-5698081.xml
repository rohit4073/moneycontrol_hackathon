<p>"We welcome the decision to hike the duty on tobacco products by 10-15 percent but we feel that the increase should have been across the board. Bidis should not have been exempted from that," NOTE national convener Shekhar Salkar told PTI after the Union Budget was tabled in Parliament.</p>
<p>Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, in the Budget presented today, increased Excise duty on tobacco products by 10 to 15 percent, but exempted bidis.</p>
<p>"The motive of taxation on tobacco products is not to gain money, but to make the products expensive so that they are unaffordable for the people. The aim is to protect health of the people," he said.</p>
<p>"Of the total tobacco consumption, 80 percent is of bidis. It is a major factor but has been left out of the purview of tax increase," Salkar said.</p>
<p>"We don't mind if the rise in Excise duty is mere five percent but it should have been across the board, why exempt bidis from it. The issue is concerning health of the people," he said.</p>]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d01.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2015/356x200/c/cigarettes_bidi_making_1_4119_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2016-02-29 15:50:03</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
