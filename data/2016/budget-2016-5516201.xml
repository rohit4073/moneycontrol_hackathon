He has short term buy call on <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/auto-carsjeeps/mahindramahindra/MM">M&amp;M</a> and <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/computers-software/tataconsultancyservices/TCS">TCS</a>. <br /><br />The banking sector, which is reeling under bank loans, will continue to see stress, he says adding that more clarity is needed on provisioning and other measures to resolve the issues. <br /><br /><strong><em>Watch videos for more.</em></strong>]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d03.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2016/356x200/b/Budget_markets_bse_nse_sensex_stock_market_356x200_1759_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2016-02-16 20:59:29</Entry_Date><Category>MARKET OUTLOOK</Category><sc_id>,TCS,MM,</sc_id><Video_flag>1</Video_flag></article></news>
