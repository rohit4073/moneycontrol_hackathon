<p>"It is a common man's Budget as all the priorities have been included to cater to the needs of the 'aam aadmi'. It is the Budget of the farmers, poor and villagers," Singh said in a statement.</p>
<p>It will give an impetus to socio-economic development of the country and will prove to be a historic Budget in the days to come, he said.</p>
<p>The CM congratulated Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley for presenting a "pro-people" Budget, keeping in mind the welfare of the masses.</p>
<p>"Jaitley laid stress on infrastructure development apart from social sectors in the Budget. Top priority was given to rural development, agriculture, school education, higher education, skills' development and medical and health sectors.</p>
<p>The Budget will help farmers, workers, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Backward Classes and minorities," Singh said.</p>
<p>It is heartening to note that each gram panchayat will be allocated Rs 80 lakh of additional funds which will help in development of basic infrastructure of rural areas, he said.</p>
<p>Besides, the Budget had set a target of increasing organic farming on five-lakh acre, which is a positive sign to come, he added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the main opposition Congress in the state criticised the Budget saying that it has added to burden of the common man.</p>
<p>"The Union Budget is directionless. It will increase burden on people," state Congress chief Bhupesh Baghel said.</p>
<p>He said the Narendra Modi government's second full Budget has clarified that it has done nothing, but talk. Poor people have been totally ignored in the Budget.</p>
<p>No change in income tax slab has also disappointed the salaried and middle class, Baghel alleged.</p>]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d01.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/default/Budget12_356x200.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2016-02-29 16:16:07</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
