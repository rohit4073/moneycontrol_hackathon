The 9-pillar approach lays specific focus on industry sectors while slicing out timely and feasible objectives with clarity for execution.<br /><br />The current budget lays tremendous focus on rural development and resource mobilization for the rural economy while endorsing technology as a key platform for ensuring accountability and ease of operations. <br /><br />Moreover the digital literacy scheme proposed to cover 6 crore additional rural households comes in as a very welcome move. Targeting more than 70 percent of the country&rsquo;s population and enhancing digital literacy in this segment will ensure deeper penetration of the digital platform in rural India while driving the macro scheme of &lsquo;Digital India and Digital Money&rsquo; with a renewed vigor.&rdquo;]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d01.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2016/356x200/b/Budget2016_Arun_Jaitley_budget_FM_budget_356x200_4209_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2016-02-29 18:24:32</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
