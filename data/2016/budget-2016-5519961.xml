The brokerage expects the government to make some "rural noises" in the upcoming Budget.<br /><br />Three reasons why CLSA feels a rural recovery is still some way off:<br />(Excerpts from the report)<br /><br /><em>* <strong>Lack of fiscal space:</strong> If the Government follows a tight fiscal policy (deficit of 3.5%), rural push would not be possible. Also, nearly 80% of the Government expenditure is already committed.</em><br /> <br /><em>* <strong>Limited government impact:</strong> The Government&rsquo;s 61 percent YTD (year-till-date) jump in capex in FY16 did not drive an overall capex upturn, as Government share of total spending is small and cannot drive a big delta&nbsp;in economic trends in just one year directly. </em><br /><br /><em>* <strong>Weak construction:</strong> Rural recovery needs construction activity uptick and more so property sector revival, which does not appear likely in CY16.</em>]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d02.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2016/356x200/b/Budget2016_India_GDP_Growth_inflation_rise_down_economy_foodgrains_food_dal_farmers_agriculture_356x200_3857_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2016-02-17 09:02:23</Entry_Date><Category>FII View</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
