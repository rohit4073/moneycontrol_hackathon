<p>On account of an almost "stagnant" steel demand globally, particularly in China, major producers are pushing products into the Indian market, which is leading to a surge in steel imports, said the 2015-16 report card of the economy tabled by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in Parliament today.</p>
<p>The domestic steel industry, with higher borrowing and raw material costs and lower productivity, is at a comparative disadvantage. To check this, government initiated several measures to curb surging imports and make domestic production sustainable, it added.</p>
<p>"Any further safeguards will impact downstream industries as steel is used as an input in different industries like basic metal and non-metal products, machineries, transport, construction and consumer goods," the Survey said.</p>
<p>It is estimated that for a 10 percent increase in steel prices due to a hike in anti-dumping or import duties, the cost of production of basic metal and non-metal products will increase by 5.4 percent, it added.</p>
<p>Besides, cost of production in construction sector will go up by 1.7 percent, machineries by 1.3 percent, transport by 0.7 percent and the consumer goods sector by 0.4 percent, it said.</p>
<p>During June-August period, the government raised basic customs duties on certain primary iron and steel products by up to 2.5 percent.</p>
<p>In June itself, anti-dumping duties were imposed, ranging from USD 180-316 per tonne, for industrial grade stainless steel imported from China, Malaysia and South Korea.</p>
<p>Forty countries had initiated anti-dumping measures including the US, EU, Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, and nine countries also imposed countervailing duties (CVD).</p>
<p>In September, government clamped provisional safeguard duty on hot-rolled flat products of non-alloy and other alloy steel in coils at the rate of 20 percent ad-valorem for a period of 200 days, while it also reduced export duty on iron ore to 10 percent for select steel (grade less than 58 percent iron content).</p>
<p>Earlier this month, minimum import price (MIP) was also imposed on 174 steel products for a period of six months.</p>]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d03.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2015/356x200/s/steel-30-09-2015-356_1409_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2016-02-26 14:16:08</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
