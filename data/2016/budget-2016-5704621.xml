The subsidy bill for the same is estimated at Rs 2.31 lakh crore for 2016-17. <br /><br />The government has put Rs 1.34 crore for food subsidy as against Rs 1.39 crore last year. Fertiliser subsidy has been earmarked at Rs 70,000 crore for the year as against Rs 72,437 crore last year. <br /><br />In an interview with CNBC-TV18, Ratan Watal, Secretary, Finance says that the government has not being conservative on the food subsidy number. <br /><br />Chief Economic Advisor (CEA), Arvind Subramanian says that Aadhaar is one of the key aspects of this Budget, which will help smoothen transmission of subsidies.<br /> <br />&ldquo;Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) using Aadhaar can be extended to food, kerosene,&rdquo; he adds. <br /><br />The government will try mobilising funds through alternate resources like bonds. &ldquo;Looking at anchors other than fiscal targets to decide on framework,&rdquo; Subramanian says. <br /><br />Watal further says that there might be a payout of Rs 5,456 crore on account of One Rank, One Pension (OROP) this year. &ldquo;Allowance form a major chunk of OROP payout,&rdquo; he adds. <br /><br />On the 7th Pay Commission, Watal says the provisioning could be around Rs 65,000 crore to Rs 68,000 crore for 2016-17. Road and railway infrastructure spending is expected to cross Rs 2 lakh crore, he adds.<br /><br />&ldquo;(Government) is looking at new ways of managing government divestment policy,&rdquo; Watal says. <br /><br /><em><strong>Below is the transcript of Arvind Subramanian and Ratan P Watal&rsquo;s interview with Shereen Bhan on CNBC-TV18.</strong></em><br /><br /><strong>Q: If I could start by asking you to just take us through the break up I am looking at the food subsidiary head, Rs 1.4 lakh crore, this is the same as the revised estimate as well. The Budget estimate is the same as the revised estimate. Does this factor in the full roll-out of the food security act because that kicks in now?</strong><br /><br /><strong>Watal:</strong> We have kept it at the same level because there are large number of measures which are being taken across the board in which we are looking at more efficient ways in which we can manage the subsidy.<br /><br /><strong>Q: But have you been a tad conservative on this number?</strong><br /><br /><strong>Watal:</strong> Being conservative? No, it will work this year.<br /><br /><strong>Q: What kind of efficiencies are you expecting on that front, because the full roll-out has not even taken place yet.</strong><br /><br /><strong>Watal:</strong> That also will take this entire year in the sense that all the states are not completely on board, but we are taking, we will take measures in terms of experiments in direct benefit transfer (DBT) have started for example, where probably we are able to weed out a large number of persons who are taking a double subsidy or something like that. <br /><br />There are a large number of measures like that which we are contemplating, which will make use of this expenditure.<br /><br /><strong>Q: If that does not come through, if the kind of efficiencies that you are hoping for does not come through, is there a danger of you slipping on this number because this could add to the fiscal challenges that Mr Subramanian has been talking about.</strong><br /><br /><strong>Watal:</strong> I do not think because the experience has been pretty good, actually if you look at it on the fertiliser side, where we went into this neem quoting, which in fact started 2-3 months back, and also some other efficiency measures which were taken on the fertiliser subsidy area of gas pooling, etc, which has started paying dividends. <br /><br />In fact, these are mirrors which will help us containing our subsidy expenditures. And as you said, along the way, we do have around October-November, we look at this entire process of what we call revised estimates and these are measures we look at. <br /><br />We go through these details, but looking at the past experience, especially on the fertiliser side, where we have made a lot of gains, we are confident that this number is alright.<br /><br /><strong>Q: That you will be able to stick to the revised estimate as far as the food subsidy is concerned. Let me also then ask you as far as the OROP, and the outgo on account of the Seventh Pay Commission is concerned, so the OROP, the provision is Rs 12,456 crore. As far as the Seventh Pay Commission, the recommendation, the outgo was expected to be about Rs 74,000 crore. Can you take us through what the provision is, because I understand that a committee will be set up and so on and so forth, but what is the broad provisioning on the Seventh Pay Commission?</strong><br /><br /><strong>Watal:</strong> I will tell you. As far as the OROP is concerned, we have on the arrears, there might be a payout of about Rs 5,456 crore or so and on an average, estimate of recurring expenditure of Rs 7,000 which in the large Budget of the Defence Ministry, we will be able to. <br /><br />We have factored that and it can be handled. As far as the Seventh Pay Commission is concerned, if you look at the Pay Commission recommendations in total, we were crossing a lakh of crore. But they can be divided into three parts in the sense, you have salaries, you have pensions and you have allowances. <br /><br />In fact, allowances are something which form the major chunk of a payout. But then, that is also prospective.<br /><br />Now, there is a committee headed by the Cabinet Secretary which is actually looking at all these recommendations as to what has to be given in terms of, or whatever the recommendations are, we are also engaging with major stake holders like the railways, the joint consultative machinery (JCM) and other beneficiaries of the Pay Commission. In that context, we have as you mentioned, factored in around in the range of Rs 65,000-68,000 crore, that is my estimate of money.<br /><br />Now it will all depend on what the recommendations of this committee is going to be during the course of the year. And then we will take it from there. We are confident that it can be.<br /><br /><strong>Q: That it can be between Rs 65,000-68,000 crore and not the 74,000 crore that the Seventh Pay Commission was recommending.</strong><br /><br /><strong>Watal:</strong> Let me tell you, in a Pay Commission, normally people factor in that full amount and that tends to give a kind of spike in the expenditure for the year. But there are in-built ways of seeing that this can be levelised over a time. <br /><br />There have been things in a situation in the past where Pay Commissions have been implemented, not in time. In this government, the Pay Commission was set up, it gave its report in 18 months, we are ready with it, it is under consideration and I am sure the (interrupted)<br /><br /><strong>Q: But, it would then be fair to say that the government expects the outgo to be significantly lower than what the Pay Commission is recommending.</strong><br /><br /><strong>Watal:</strong> I would not say that, I cannot pre-judge what the committee is going to recommend.<br /><br /><strong>Q: You said you are broadly working with Rs 65,000-68,000 crore.</strong><br /><br /><strong>Watal:</strong> I told you in the beginning that there are some things which are prospective, some things which are given as arrears. Now as expenditure secretary, I would like that I do not generate any arrear because everything kicks in from January 1. Now, I can pay this out in this year, sometimes, it can be carried on to the next year, it can be levelised. But the full payout will be there whatever is decided.<br /><br /><strong>Q: Let me also then ask you a question as far as subsidies are concerned, because you said that subsidies must remain below 1.6 percent of GDP. Can we expect, as we move towards the Jan Dhan Yojana, Aadhaar and mobile numbers (JAM) Trinity for this number to be significantly lower and what could that possibly be over the next few years, do you think?</strong><br /><br /><strong>Subramanian:</strong> One of the very important measures in this Budget is this Aadhar bill that the Finance Minister announced, because if you recall, there has been some uncertainty over the use of Aadhar for some of these direct transfers. So, once that is in place, that will remove any residual uncertainty going forward. <br /><br />So, that going forward, the DBT agenda, the JAM agenda can be extended to other areas as well &ndash; food, kerosene, and then also in the Budget, pilots in fertiliser have also been announced. <br /><br />And of course, we are already doing that in government programmes already. So, in a sense, laying the architecture &ndash; the legal and the physical infrastructure for pushing the JAM agenda with significant possibilities for savings in the next few years.<br /><br /><strong>Q: What could that percentage of GDP as and when we start to see the full benefits of moving towards jam?</strong><br /><br /><strong>Subramanian:</strong> That is very difficult to say now. What we can say is this based on experience, the Pahal scheme where we implemented this, the Economic Survey did a rigorous analysis. We have saved 25 percent in the Pahal scheme because of the DBT, which comes almost entirely from a de-duplication and elimination of the ghost beneficiaries. <br /><br />So that is kind of the scope of savings that one can expect, once the jam thing is implemented in other areas.<br /><br />_PAGEBREAK_<br /><br /><strong>Q: There has been a lot of emphasis on how the government needs to be at the forefront of spending in order to try and stimulate growth, if I were to look at a percentage of capital expenditure, it is 12 percent or you are expecting it to be at 12 percent, so there is not any great change over FY16 and what should we expect for FY17, am I right?</strong><br /><br /><strong>Watal:</strong> Yes, we are maintaining it at that level for the time being.<br /><br /><strong>Q: You believe that this is going to be enough to try and give a fillip or as much a fillip that we are hoping for?</strong><br /><br /><strong>Watal:</strong> It is a balance that we have tried to do in terms of keeping the fiscal targets in mind.<br /><br /><strong>Subramanian:</strong> Just to add to what Ratan Watal is saying that what you have quoted is the Budgetary number in addition, we are going to finance it through other sources especially through bonds which the government is going to support.<br /><br /><strong>Watal:</strong> I would just like to add there what Arvind Subramanian said for example in railways, the Budgetary support is about Rs 45,000 crore. We have a plan Budget of nearly Rs 1.2 lakh crore over there where the railways is going to raise its own resources.<br /><br /><strong>Q: For the roads, it is only Rs 15,000 crore additionally that you are looking by way of bonds?</strong><br /><br /><strong>Watal:</strong> Yes but the whole amount, which is also going to be given to the Sadak Yojana etc where nearly Rs 19,000 crore is being given, if we take roads, railways put together, it is going to cross nearly Rs 2 lakh crore amount of money which is going to be put in to the sector. <br /><br />So it is a combination of both support from the government but also resources being generated outside and here I am not adding things like the irrigation sector etc where special measures are being taken to support low hanging fruit in canals and other places where we can pass on money to the state governments to implement their schemes.<br /><br /><strong>Q: Let me start by asking you as far as the review of the fiscal framework is concerned and the Finance Minister is now saying that the committee will be set up, in fact you Ratan Watal did say that there is a case now to look at fiscal deficit on a consolidated basis between centre and state that is something that you have been pushing as well, as the CEA, what should we now realistically expect as far as this reworking of the FRBM is concerned in the context of what we have seen being articulated today?</strong><br /><br /><strong>Subramanian:</strong> As I have said and we have said in the Economic Survey as well, there are very good intrinsic reasons unrelated to 3.9-3.5, why we need to re-evaluate the medium-term framework. We need an expenditure framework that is medium-term especially now with the Planning Commission having given way to the NITI Aayog, we need some medium-term expenditure planning.<br /><br />On the fiscal framework itself, we have had a fiscal deficit rule. I think we want to see whether there are other anchors that we can provide either debt targets, golden rules, effective revenue deficit and also to be able to -- within a fiscal anchor -- provide for the possibility of counter cyclical policy as well.<br /><br />So all of these things are going to be part of this what this committee will look at, so that in a sense what we are saying is that, we need a fiscal framework, medium-term framework for 21st century.<br /><br /><strong>Q: As far as the disinvestment side of the story is concerned in terms of what was budgeted in the previous year and what has finally happened, it's about Rs 25,000 crore versus almost Rs 70,000 crore if you include strategic divestments that was budgeted for FY16. In FY17, you have been little more pragmatic perhaps in your provisioning and you have budgeted about Rs 56,000 crore, Rs 20,000 crore by way of strategic sales -- that is a matter that is fraught with all kinds of complexities and challenges. If we were to fall short on the disinvestment side again, do you think that you have significant cushion to be able to absorb that hit?</strong><br /><br /><strong>Watal:</strong> I won't get into any hypothetical questions whether we will fall short or not. However, even last year if the situation had been alright, if the market had not been, if the commodity prices have been healthy, we could have achieved these targets but other measures were taken where we could achieve these 3.9 and this year's target of Rs 56,000-57,000 crore which you are mentioning, again has been divided into two sections; one, pure divestment which will normally happen which is a reasonable figure, there is strategic disinvestment and the department of disinvestment has also been revamped now. <br /><br />This portion is now going to be looked at by the NITI Aayog and I am sure we will get there. We are looking at this whole thing of management of government assets in a different way now and I do not think there is any point in being pessimistic at the beginning or being sceptical because this is the fourth time I am coming here and I am told every year that I will not be able to achieve my targets, I will fall short but I come back here and say I have done it. <br /><br /><strong>Subramanian:</strong> On a strategic disinvestment what I would add is that we need a policy framework to support the strategic disinvestment and that policy framework is being put in place which will support that. I think that will lend credibility to the target as well.<br /><br /><strong>Q: What to your mind do you see as the big risk or the big challenges that could create some problems with the fiscal math that you have put out?</strong><br /><br /><strong>Watal:</strong> I think the way we have worked out he revenue figures and the cushions that we have build in, if you ask me I could do better than that also but we have to spend, we have public investment and other things to do.]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d02.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2014/356x200/s/subsidy_356x200_1648_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2016-02-29 18:45:46</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><Video_flag>1</Video_flag></article></news>
