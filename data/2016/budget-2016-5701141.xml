The budget&rsquo;s direction is positive with several macro factors making way for a better economic regime. The proposal to provide additional exemption of Rs 50,000 for housing loans up to Rs 35 lakh is quite optimistic. However, few more amendments in the residential housing sector would have worked out better for the sector. But we hope there is a strong reinforcement in the real estate industry this year.&rdquo;]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d03.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2016/356x200/b/Budget_2016_budget2016_real_estate_smart_city_fiscal_deficit_356x200_2331_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2016-02-29 17:33:21</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
