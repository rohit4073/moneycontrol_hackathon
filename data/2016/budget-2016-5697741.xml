The government has proposed commendable measures to remove the economic inequities by giving the poor a higher budgetary provision while taxing the rich. The government has also moved ahead with Make in India campaign and promised easing of custom and excise duties to boost manufacturing in the country. Tax structure of small companies has been made favourable while large infrastructure companies can raise funds by issuing infrastructure bonds. Overall, this is a good budget. The focus now turns to what happens to GST."</p>]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d01.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2016/356x200/s/Sensex_Budget2016_nifty_bse_nse_stockmarkets_jaitley_FM_finance_Down__356x200_5038_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2016-02-29 16:36:26</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
