However, allocation to the education sector including mid-day meals was trimmed to Rs 68,968 crore from Rs 70,505 crore allotted in the previous budget.</p>
<p>A higher Budget for basic education may not necessarily be the answer to India&rsquo;s problem of low adult literacy rates compared to other BRICS nations. Despite government spending on education having more than doubled over the last decade, the system is suffering from poorly trained teachers, (and consequently quality of teaching) and a high drop out rate among the poor.</p>
<p>Access to basic education remains the backbone for any developing nation. Budget 2016 should focus on ways to improve the quality of teaching in government schools, and address the reasons for the high drop out ratio.</p>]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d01.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2015/356x200/d/Digital-education-356_4322_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2016-02-08 12:50:26</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
