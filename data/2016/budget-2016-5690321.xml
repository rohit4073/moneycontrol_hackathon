]]></Summary><Body><![CDATA[<p>Finance minister Arun Jaitley has pegged India's nominal GDP growth at 11 percent&nbsp;in FY17, despite global volatility.</p>
<p>In his previous Budget, Jaitley had said he expects the Indian economy to grow at 8-8.5 percent (real GDP). However, it was later revised downward to 7.2 percent.</p>
<p>Recently, the Central Statistics Office (CSO) said the full-year GDP forecast has been revised upward to 7.6 percent on the back of benign crude oil prices and a sharp uptick in manufacturing.<br /><br />Nominal GDP is a gross domestic product (GDP) figure that has not been adjusted for inflation. Real GDP is an inflation adjusted rate of growth.</p>
<p>In recent times, a lot of questions have been raised on the manufacturing growth number considering India has consistently been clocking lower industrial production or IIP number.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, India's gross domestic product or GDP grew at 7.6 percent in the first quarter, 7.7 percent in the second quarter and 7.3 percent in the third quarter.</p>]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d02.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2014/356x200/g/GDP_356x200_1508_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2016-02-29 13:00:27</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
