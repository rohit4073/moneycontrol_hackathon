UltraTech with the geographical spread and with this additional 33 percent capacity that comes at a very decent price means that the gap between UltraTech and the other plays is only going to grow. So, the pricing power they get, the ability to reach out to all large customers as and when there is a pick-up, I am sure that the Budget will have some announcement related to smart cities and roads and things like that &ndash; housing for instance."<br /><br />"So, cement is in a sweet spot now at least. We have seen a bottoming out completely. So, I am quite positive on the stock. You could look at Rs 3,500 possibly in the next 6-9 months," he said.<br /><br />"Very clearly, there is enough and more on banks that look kind of positive, and <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/banks-publicsector/statebankindia/SBI">State Bank of India</a> (SBI) at Rs 155 levels, you really do not face a huge risk on that."&nbsp;<br /><br />"The second stock is <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/auto-carsjeeps/marutisuzukiindia/MS24">Maruti Suzuki</a>. It&nbsp;is another one of my favourite stocks. It has come down for reasons which are much beyond Indian markets and the yen firming up has been unfortunate in terms of timing. But that will also reverse as we have seen an end come to the carry trade. So, that is going to change and with the Seventh Pay Commission getting kicked off, there is no reason why Maruti has to struggle."]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d03.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2015/356x200/u/ultratech356_1900_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2016-02-29 09:42:33</Entry_Date><Category>Stocks Views</Category><sc_id>,UTC,SBI,MU01,</sc_id><Video_flag>1</Video_flag></article></news>
