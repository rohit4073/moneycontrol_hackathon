The economic survey reveals that 46.6 percent of households do not have drinking water within premises and less than 50 percent have latrine facilities within their premises. <br /><br />According to World Health Organisation (WHO) and UNICEF monitoring programme, in 2015, nearly 61 percent of rural Indians defecated in the open. <br />While the problems as above exist, new missions like Swachh Bharat have helped in filing gaps in certain areas. The mission aims to eradicate open defecation in India by October 2, 2019. <br /><br />The mission is gunning for better hygiene practices and facilities across India, in both urban and rural areas. <br /><br />&ldquo;In its first year, i.e. from 2 October 2014 to 2 October 2015, 88 lakh toilets were constructed, against an expected outcome of 60 lakhs,&rdquo; says the survey. <br /><br />The survey further adds that more than 122 lakh toilets gave been constructed in rural areas. NSSO data reveals that sanitation coverage has risen to 48.8 percent in December 2015 from 40.60 percent from 2011.<br /><br />While the numbers does not seem to be big compared to the complexity of the issue, it is a step in the right direction. The Swachh Bharat Mission will start showing results once these toilets are maintained and utilised by the beneficiaries.]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d01.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2016/356x200/e/ECONOMIC_SURVEY_economy_busget2016_356x200.jpg_2543_356.png]]></Image><Entry_Date>2016-02-26 20:58:34</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
