<p>The Sensex is down 10.06 points at 23144.24 and the Nifty is down 6.75 points at 7023.00. About 532 shares have advanced, 434 shares declined, and 57 shares are unchanged.</p>
<p>ITC, Hero, Cipla, Adani Ports and GAIL are major losers in the Sensex.<br /><br />As Finance Minister Arun Jaitley presents Union Budget today, the market will focus on credibility of numbers. Investors will be keen to know if the govt deviates from the fiscal consolidation roadmap in order to boost growth. The other big fear the market has is the possible extension of the long term capital gains tax tenure from 1 to 3 years or the possibility of reintroduction of a tax itself.</p>]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d02.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2016/356x200/b/BUDGET2016_Finance_minister_Arun_jaitley_FM_sensex_bse_nifty_markets_stocksmarkets356x200_3415_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2016-02-29 09:25:13</Entry_Date><Category>Local Markets</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
