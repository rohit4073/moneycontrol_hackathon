<p>Local chapter of Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry President D Nanndakumar said the budget addressed key issues on innovative measures and highlighted the out laying of investment opportunities and new financing methods.</p>
<p>Complimenting Union Minister Suresh Prabhu for having taken a bold step to announce such an overall "matured" Rail Budget, he said the chamber welcomed the positive announcements like 'no hike' in railway fares, installation of CCTV in all stations, commissioning of WIFI facilities in 100 stations this year, E- Ticketing facilities through Foreign Debit and Credit Cards and so on.</p>
<p>However, the Chamber expressed its deep concern and disappointment, as none of the demands of Coimbatoreans found place including the long pending demand for introduction of an exclusive express train between Coimbatore and Bengaluru.</p>
<p>Tirupur Exporters Association President A Sakthivel welcomed the budget for keeping the rail fares and freight charges at the same level, as it would be beneficial to the people across the board.</p>]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d02.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2016/356x200/r/Railways_budget_2016_suresh_prabhu_Rail_min_356x200_4336_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2016-02-26 08:24:07</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
