Global economy is in a serious crisis and global growth has slowed. Financial markets are battered but confidence is being built around India, says Jaitley. The Sensex is up 121.79 points or 0.5 percent at 23276.09, and the Nifty is up 32.90 points or 0.5 percent at 7062.65. About 919 shares have advanced, 1052 shares declined, and 121 shares are unchanged.
<p>As Finance Minister Arun Jaitley presents Union Budget today, the market will focus on credibility of numbers. Investors will be keen to know if the govt deviates from the fiscal consolidation roadmap in order to boost growth. The other big fear the market has is the possible extension of the long term capital gains tax tenure from 1 to 3 years or the possibility of reintroduction of a tax itself.</p>
