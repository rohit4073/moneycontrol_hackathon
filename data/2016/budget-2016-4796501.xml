<p>The steep drop in farm income has been a drag on overall economic growth, with two-wheeler companies and consumer goods companies feeling it the most.</p>
<p>Budget 2015 was largely a disappointment for the farmers as it did not address any specific issues, other than raising farm loan limit to Rs 8.5 lakh crore from Rs 8 lakh crore.</p>
<p>With crop losses and farmer suicides making headlines regularly, the government might even come out with a relief package for agriculture in the Budget. The government will also be looking to shore up some political capital, given that agriculture accounts for roughly 17 percent of GDP and nearly half the nation&rsquo;s working population.</p>
<p>There could be some announcement relating to the universal crop insurance scheme for small and marginal farmers, proposed by the RBI panel headed by Deepak Mohanty</p>]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d01.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2015/356x200/a/Agriculture_fertilizer_budget2015_inflation_farmer_tractor_356x200_1646_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2016-02-08 13:48:42</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
