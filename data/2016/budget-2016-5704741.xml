The biggest take away from this budget is Finance Minister Arun Jaitley&rsquo;s commitment to the path of fiscal consolidation. There was pressure on him to have an expansionary budget targeting growth but he has not compromised on fiscal discipline even as his focus remained on growth, driven by domestic demand and a slew of reforms. It has equal emphasis on the firm sector, creation of jobs as well as infrastructure. Finally, this Budget is as much about ease of doing business in India as ease of paying taxes.&rdquo;]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d02.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/2016/356x200/b/Budget2016_Arun_Jaitley_budget_FM_budget_Finance_356x200_4344_356.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2016-02-29 18:55:39</Entry_Date><Category>Economy</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
