<p>Tapan Kumar Chand was elected unanimously at the National Governing Council Meeting of the AAI held here. AAI is the apex body representing the entire spectrum of Indian aluminium industry and is a part of the world association, Nalco said in a release.</p>
<p>Earlier, the post of president was held by S K Roongta, former chairman of SAIL and Vedanta Group.</p>
<p>On assuming the post of president, Chand welcomed the Union Budget 2016-17, describing it as a balanced budget with focus on growth.</p>
<p>"On behalf of all the primary, secondary and downstream aluminium producers, I thank the government for its proposal to increase the Basic Customs Duty (BCD) on primary aluminium from five percent to 7.5 percent and on aluminium products from 7.5 percent to ten percent. This move will help Indian aluminium industry by checking influx of cheap imports," he said.</p>
<p>However, the industry's expectation was a five percent increase in BCD, he said.</p>
<p>Prof K S S Murthy, General Secretary of AAI, under Chand, AAI would have assertive and affirmative approach in promoting consumption of aluminium and boosting the growth of the aluminium industry.</p>
<p>The AAI further announced that the next International Conference on Aluminium (INCAL) would be organised in Bhubaneswar, wherein all overseas associations would take part.</p>
<p>The theme of the event would be 'Make in India : Aluminium the Strategic Metal,' the release said.</p>]]></Body><Image><![CDATA[http://img-d03.moneycontrol.co.in/news_image_files/default/Budget1_356x200.jpg]]></Image><Entry_Date>2016-02-29 20:28:03</Entry_Date><Category>Business</Category><Video_flag>0</Video_flag></article></news>
