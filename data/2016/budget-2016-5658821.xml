We will have to see what the government does with respect to rural allocations. I am expecting expansionary Budget especially in the context that you will have state election. So, I think there will be certain allocation for rural sector as well. So, in consumer space, the picks that we have are <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/paintsvarnishes/asianpaints/AP31">Asian Paints</a>, <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/foodprocessing/britanniaindustries/BI">Britannia Industries</a> and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/personalcare/marico/M13">Marico</a>."<br /><br />"In the banking space, we still sort of like the consumer banks such as <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/banks-privatesector/yesbank/YB">YES Bank</a>, <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/banks-privatesector/hdfcbank/HDF01">HDFC Bank</a> and maybe <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/banks-privatesector/indusindbank/IIB">IndusInd Bank</a>.
