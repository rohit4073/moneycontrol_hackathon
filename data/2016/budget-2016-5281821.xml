Banks will get about Rs 5,000 crore," Financial Services Secretary Ajuly Chib Duggal said on the sidelines of an event here. </p>
<p>Funds would be infused after Parliament approves third Supplementary Demand for Grants in the upcoming Budget session.<br /><br /> Last year, the government announced a revamp plan 'Indradhanush' to infuse Rs 70,000 crore in state-owned banks over four years, while they will have to raise a further Rs 1.1 lakh crore from the markets to meet their capital requirements in line with global risk norms Basel III.<br /><br /> As per the blueprint, PSU banks will get Rs 25,000 crore this fiscal and also in the next fiscal. </p>
<p>Besides, Rs 10,000 crore each would be infused in 2017-18 and 2018-19. Of the Rs 25,000 crore earmarked for 2015-16, the government has pumped in about Rs 20,088 crore in 13 public sector banks so far. <br /><br />Talking about various initiatives taken by the government to deepen social security net, Duggal said banks are addressing last mile connectivity issues. </p>
<p>The Department of Financial Services is having discussion with banks on regular basis to sort out the issues as soon as possible, she said. Banks like <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/banks-publicsector/statebankindia/SBI">SBI</a> and <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/banks-publicsector/andhrabank/AB14">Andhra Bank</a> are currently addressing issue of internet connectivity in the 800 identified areas.
